1:1 Now king David was old and stricken in years; and they coveredhim with clothes, but he gat no heat.
1:2 Wherefore his servants said unto him, Let there be sought for mylord the king a young virgin: and let her stand before the king, andlet her cherish him, and let her lie in thy bosom, that my lord theking may get heat.
1:3 So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the coasts ofIsrael, and found Abishag a Shunammite, and brought her to the king.
1:4 And the damsel was very fair, and cherished the king, andministered to him: but the king knew her not.
1:5 Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I willbe king: and he prepared him chariots and horsemen, and fifty men torun before him.
1:6 And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Whyhast thou done so? and he also was a very goodly man; and his motherbare him after Absalom.
1:7 And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiatharthe priest: and they following Adonijah helped him.
1:8 But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathanthe prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men which belonged toDavid, were not with Adonijah.
1:9 And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone ofZoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brethren the king'ssons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants: 
1:10 But Nathanthe prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother,he called not.
1:11 Wherefore Nathan spake unto Bathsheba the mother of Solomon,saying, Hast thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith dothreign, and David our lord knoweth it not?  
1:12 Now therefore come,let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou mayest save thineown life, and the life of thy son Solomon.
1:13 Go and get thee in unto king David, and say unto him, Didst notthou, my lord, O king, swear unto thine handmaid, saying, AssuredlySolomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?why then doth Adonijah reign?  
1:14 Behold, while thou yet talkestthere with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thywords.
1:15 And Bathsheba went in unto the king into the chamber: and theking was very old; and Abishag the Shunammite ministered unto theking.
1:16 And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance unto the king. And theking said, What wouldest thou?  
1:17 And she said unto him, My lord,thou swarest by the LORD thy God unto thine handmaid, saying,Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit uponmy throne.
1:18 And now, behold, Adonijah reigneth; and now, my lord the king,thou knowest it not: 
1:19 And he hath slain oxen and fat cattle andsheep in abundance, and hath called all the sons of the king, andAbiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon thyservant hath he not called.
1:20 And thou, my lord, O king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee,that thou shouldest tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lordthe king after him.
1:21 Otherwise it shall come to pass, when my lord the king shallsleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be countedoffenders.
1:22 And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophetalso came in.
1:23 And they told the king, saying, Behold Nathan the prophet. Andwhen he was come in before the king, he bowed himself before the kingwith his face to the ground.
1:24 And Nathan said, My lord, O king, hast thou said, Adonijah shallreign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?  
1:25 For he is gonedown this day, and hath slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep inabundance, and hath called all the king's sons, and the captains ofthe host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drinkbefore him, and say, God save king Adonijah.
1:26 But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiahthe son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, hath he not called.
1:27 Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou hast not shewedit unto thy servant, who should sit on the throne of my lord the kingafter him?  
1:28 Then king David answered and said, Call me Bathsheba.And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.
1:29 And the king sware, and said, As the LORD liveth, that hathredeemed my soul out of all distress, 
1:30 Even as I sware unto theeby the LORD God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shallreign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead; even sowill I certainly do this day.
1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and didreverence to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live for ever.
1:32 And king David said, Call me Zadok the priest, and Nathan theprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before theking.
1:33 The king also said unto them, Take with you the servants of yourlord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon mine own mule, and bringhim down to Gihon: 
1:34 And let Zadok the priest and Nathan theprophet anoint him there king over Israel: and blow ye with thetrumpet, and say, God save king Solomon.
1:35 Then ye shall come up after him, that he may come and sit upon mythrone; for he shall be king in my stead: and I have appointed him tobe ruler over Israel and over Judah.
1:36 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said,Amen: the LORD God of my lord the king say so too.
1:37 As the LORD hath been with my lord the king, even so be he withSolomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord kingDavid.
1:38 So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the sonof Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, andcaused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him toGihon.
1:39 And Zadok the priest took an horn of oil out of the tabernacle,and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet; and all the peoplesaid, God save king Solomon.
1:40 And all the people came up after him, and the people piped withpipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with thesound of them.
1:41 And Adonijah and all the guests that were with him heard it asthey had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of thetrumpet, he said, Wherefore is this noise of the city being in anuproar?  
1:42 And while he yet spake, behold, Jonathan the son ofAbiathar the priest came; and Adonijah said unto him, Come in; forthou art a valiant man, and bringest good tidings.
1:43 And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Verily our lord kingDavid hath made Solomon king.
1:44 And the king hath sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan theprophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and thePelethites, and they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule:
1:45 And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed himking in Gihon: and they are come up from thence rejoicing, so that thecity rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.
1:46 And also Solomon sitteth on the throne of the kingdom.
1:47 And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord kingDavid, saying, God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, andmake his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himselfupon the bed.
1:48 And also thus said the king, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel,which hath given one to sit on my throne this day, mine eyes evenseeing it.
1:49 And all the guests that were with Adonijah were afraid, and roseup, and went every man his way.
1:50 And Adonijah feared because of Solomon, and arose, and went, andcaught hold on the horns of the altar.
1:51 And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah feareth kingSolomon: for, lo, he hath caught hold on the horns of the altar,saying, Let king Solomon swear unto me today that he will not slay hisservant with the sword.
1:52 And Solomon said, If he will shew himself a worthy man, thereshall not an hair of him fall to the earth: but if wickedness shall befound in him, he shall die.
1:53 So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar.And he came and bowed himself to king Solomon: and Solomon said untohim, Go to thine house.
2:1 Now the days of David drew nigh that he should die; and he chargedSolomon his son, saying, 
2:2 I go the way of all the earth: be thoustrong therefore, and shew thyself a man; 
2:3 And keep the charge ofthe LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, and hiscommandments, and his judgments, and his testimonies, as it is writtenin the law of Moses, that thou mayest prosper in all that thou doest,and whithersoever thou turnest thyself: 
2:4 That the LORD may continuehis word which he spake concerning me, saying, If thy children takeheed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart andwith all their soul, there shall not fail thee (said he) a man on thethrone of Israel.
2:5 Moreover thou knowest also what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me,and what he did to the two captains of the hosts of Israel, unto Abnerthe son of Ner, and unto Amasa the son of Jether, whom he slew, andshed the blood of war in peace, and put the blood of war upon hisgirdle that was about his loins, and in his shoes that were on hisfeet.
2:6 Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and let not his hoar head godown to the grave in peace.
2:7 But shew kindness unto the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, andlet them be of those that eat at thy table: for so they came to mewhen I fled because of Absalom thy brother.
2:8 And, behold, thou hast with thee Shimei the son of Gera, aBenjamite of Bahurim, which cursed me with a grievous curse in the daywhen I went to Mahanaim: but he came down to meet me at Jordan, and Isware to him by the LORD, saying, I will not put thee to death withthe sword.
2:9 Now therefore hold him not guiltless: for thou art a wise man, andknowest what thou oughtest to do unto him; but his hoar head bringthou down to the grave with blood.
2:10 So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city ofDavid.
2:11 And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years:seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reignedhe in Jerusalem.
2:12 Then sat Solomon upon the throne of David his father; and hiskingdom was established greatly.
2:13 And Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother ofSolomon. And she said, Comest thou peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.
2:14 He said moreover, I have somewhat to say unto thee. And she said,Say on.
2:15 And he said, Thou knowest that the kingdom was mine, and that allIsrael set their faces on me, that I should reign: howbeit the kingdomis turned about, and is become my brother's: for it was his from theLORD.
2:16 And now I ask one petition of thee, deny me not. And she saidunto him, Say on.
2:17 And he said, Speak, I pray thee, unto Solomon the king, (for hewill not say thee nay,) that he give me Abishag the Shunammite towife.
2:18 And Bathsheba said, Well; I will speak for thee unto the king.
2:19 Bathsheba therefore went unto king Solomon, to speak unto him forAdonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself untoher, and sat down on his throne, and caused a seat to be set for theking's mother; and she sat on his right hand.
2:20 Then she said, I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee,say me not nay. And the king said unto her, Ask on, my mother: for Iwill not say thee nay.
2:21 And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thybrother to wife.
2:22 And king Solomon answered and said unto his mother, And why dostthou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? ask for him the kingdomalso; for he is mine elder brother; even for him, and for Abiathar thepriest, and for Joab the son of Zeruiah.
2:23 Then king Solomon sware by the LORD, saying, God do so to me, andmore also, if Adonijah have not spoken this word against his own life.
2:24 Now therefore, as the LORD liveth, which hath established me, andset me on the throne of David my father, and who hath made me anhouse, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death this day.
2:25 And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada;and he fell upon him that he died.
2:26 And unto Abiathar the priest said the king, Get thee to Anathoth,unto thine own fields; for thou art worthy of death: but I will not atthis time put thee to death, because thou barest the ark of the LORDGod before David my father, and because thou hast been afflicted inall wherein my father was afflicted.
2:27 So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest unto the LORD;that he might fulfil the word of the LORD, which he spake concerningthe house of Eli in Shiloh.
2:28 Then tidings came to Joab: for Joab had turned after Adonijah,though he turned not after Absalom. And Joab fled unto the tabernacleof the LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.
2:29 And it was told king Solomon that Joab was fled unto thetabernacle of the LORD; and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomonsent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.
2:30 And Benaiah came to the tabernacle of the LORD, and said untohim, Thus saith the king, Come forth. And he said, Nay; but I will diehere. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab,and thus he answered me.
2:31 And the king said unto him, Do as he hath said, and fall uponhim, and bury him; that thou mayest take away the innocent blood,which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.
2:32 And the LORD shall return his blood upon his own head, who fellupon two men more righteous and better than he, and slew them with thesword, my father David not knowing thereof, to wit, Abner the son ofNer, captain of the host of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether,captain of the host of Judah.
2:33 Their blood shall therefore return upon the head of Joab, andupon the head of his seed for ever: but upon David, and upon his seed,and upon his house, and upon his throne, shall there be peace for everfrom the LORD.
2:34 So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, andslew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.
2:35 And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over thehost: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.
2:36 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Buildthee an house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth thenceany whither.
2:37 For it shall be, that on the day thou goest out, and passest overthe brook Kidron, thou shalt know for certain that thou shalt surelydie: thy blood shall be upon thine own head.
2:38 And Shimei said unto the king, The saying is good: as my lord theking hath said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalemmany days.
2:39 And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of theservants of Shimei ran away unto Achish son of Maachah king of Gath.And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants be in Gath.
2:40 And Shimei arose, and saddled his ass, and went to Gath to Achishto seek his servants: and Shimei went, and brought his servants fromGath.
2:41 And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem toGath, and was come again.
2:42 And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said unto him, Did Inot make thee to swear by the LORD, and protested unto thee, saying,Know for a certain, on the day thou goest out, and walkest abroad anywhither, that thou shalt surely die? and thou saidst unto me, The wordthat I have heard is good.
2:43 Why then hast thou not kept the oath of the LORD, and thecommandment that I have charged thee with?  
2:44 The king saidmoreover to Shimei, Thou knowest all the wickedness which thine heartis privy to, that thou didst to David my father: therefore the LORDshall return thy wickedness upon thine own head; 
2:45 And king Solomonshall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established beforethe LORD for ever.
2:46 So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; which wentout, and fell upon him, that he died. And the kingdom was establishedin the hand of Solomon.
3:1 And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and tookPharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until hehad made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD,and the wall of Jerusalem round about.
3:2 Only the people sacrificed in high places, because there was nohouse built unto the name of the LORD, until those days.
3:3 And Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David hisfather: only he sacrificed and burnt incense in high places.
3:4 And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was thegreat high place: a thousand burnt offerings did Solomon offer uponthat altar.
3:5 In Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night: andGod said, Ask what I shall give thee.
3:6 And Solomon said, Thou hast shewed unto thy servant David myfather great mercy, according as he walked before thee in truth, andin righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee; and thou hastkept for him this great kindness, that thou hast given him a son tosit on his throne, as it is this day.
3:7 And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king instead ofDavid my father: and I am but a little child: I know not how to go outor come in.
3:8 And thy servant is in the midst of thy people which thou hastchosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted formultitude.
3:9 Give therefore thy servant an understanding heart to judge thypeople, that I may discern between good and bad: for who is able tojudge this thy so great a people?  
3:10 And the speech pleased theLORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.
3:11 And God said unto him, Because thou hast asked this thing, andhast not asked for thyself long life; neither hast asked riches forthyself, nor hast asked the life of thine enemies; but hast asked forthyself understanding to discern judgment; 
3:12 Behold, I have doneaccording to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wise and anunderstanding heart; so that there was none like thee before thee,neither after thee shall any arise like unto thee.
3:13 And I have also given thee that which thou hast not asked, bothriches, and honour: so that there shall not be any among the kingslike unto thee all thy days.
3:14 And if thou wilt walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and mycommandments, as thy father David did walk, then I will lengthen thydays.
3:15 And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came toJerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, andoffered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made afeast to all his servants.
3:16 Then came there two women, that were harlots, unto the king, andstood before him.
3:17 And the one woman said, O my lord, I and this woman dwell in onehouse; and I was delivered of a child with her in the house.
3:18 And it came to pass the third day after that I was delivered,that this woman was delivered also: and we were together; there was nostranger with us in the house, save we two in the house.
3:19 And this woman's child died in the night; because she overlaidit.
3:20 And she arose at midnight, and took my son from beside me, whilethine handmaid slept, and laid it in her bosom, and laid her deadchild in my bosom.
3:21 And when I rose in the morning to give my child suck, behold, itwas dead: but when I had considered it in the morning, behold, it wasnot my son, which I did bear.
3:22 And the other woman said, Nay; but the living is my son, and thedead is thy son. And this said, No; but the dead is thy son, and theliving is my son. Thus they spake before the king.
3:23 Then said the king, The one saith, This is my son that liveth,and thy son is the dead: and the other saith, Nay; but thy son is thedead, and my son is the living.
3:24 And the king said, Bring me a sword. And they brought a swordbefore the king.
3:25 And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give halfto the one, and half to the other.
3:26 Then spake the woman whose the living child was unto the king,for her bowels yearned upon her son, and she said, O my lord, give herthe living child, and in no wise slay it. But the other said, Let itbe neither mine nor thine, but divide it.
3:27 Then the king answered and said, Give her the living child, andin no wise slay it: she is the mother thereof.
3:28 And all Israel heard of the judgment which the king had judged;and they feared the king: for they saw that the wisdom of God was inhim, to do judgment.
4:1 So king Solomon was king over all Israel.
4:2 And these were the princes which he had; Azariah the son of Zadokthe priest, 
4:3 Elihoreph and Ahiah, the sons of Shisha, scribes;Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud, the recorder.
4:4 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the host: and Zadok andAbiathar were the priests: 
4:5 And Azariah the son of Nathan was overthe officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, andthe king's friend: 
4:6 And Ahishar was over the household: andAdoniram the son of Abda was over the tribute.
4:7 And Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, which providedvictuals for the king and his household: each man his month in a yearmade provision.
4:8 And these are their names: The son of Hur, in mount Ephraim: 
4:9 The son of Dekar, in Makaz, and in Shaalbim, and Bethshemesh, andElonbethhanan: 
4:10 The son of Hesed, in Aruboth; to him pertainedSochoh, and all the land of Hepher: 
4:11 The son of Abinadab, in allthe region of Dor; which had Taphath the daughter of Solomon to wife:
4:12 Baana the son of Ahilud; to him pertained Taanach and Megiddo,and all Bethshean, which is by Zartanah beneath Jezreel, fromBethshean to Abelmeholah, even unto the place that is beyond Jokneam:
4:13 The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns ofJair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertainedthe region of Argob, which is in Bashan, threescore great cities withwalls and brasen bars: 
4:14 Ahinadab the son of Iddo had Mahanaim:
4:15 Ahimaaz was in Naphtali; he also took Basmath the daughter ofSolomon to wife: 
4:16 Baanah the son of Hushai was in Asher and inAloth: 
4:17 Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar: 
4:18 Shimeithe son of Elah, in Benjamin: 
4:19 Geber the son of Uri was in thecountry of Gilead, in the country of Sihon king of the Amorites, andof Og king of Bashan; and he was the only officer which was in theland.
4:20 Judah and Israel were many, as the sand which is by the sea inmultitude, eating and drinking, and making merry.
4:21 And Solomon reigned over all kingdoms from the river unto theland of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt: they broughtpresents, and served Solomon all the days of his life.
4:22 And Solomon's provision for one day was thirty measures of fineflour, and threescore measures of meal, 
4:23 Ten fat oxen, and twentyoxen out of the pastures, and an hundred sheep, beside harts, androebucks, and fallowdeer, and fatted fowl.
4:24 For he had dominion over all the region on this side the river,from Tiphsah even to Azzah, over all the kings on this side the river:and he had peace on all sides round about him.
4:25 And Judah and Israel dwelt safely, every man under his vine andunder his fig tree, from Dan even to Beersheba, all the days ofSolomon.
4:26 And Solomon had forty thousand stalls of horses for his chariots,and twelve thousand horsemen.
4:27 And those officers provided victual for king Solomon, and for allthat came unto king Solomon's table, every man in his month: theylacked nothing.
4:28 Barley also and straw for the horses and dromedaries brought theyunto the place where the officers were, every man according to hischarge.
4:29 And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding exceeding much, andlargeness of heart, even as the sand that is on the sea shore.
4:30 And Solomon's wisdom excelled the wisdom of all the children ofthe east country, and all the wisdom of Egypt.
4:31 For he was wiser than all men; than Ethan the Ezrahite, andHeman, and Chalcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol: and his fame was inall nations round about.
4:32 And he spake three thousand proverbs: and his songs were athousand and five.
4:33 And he spake of trees, from the cedar tree that is in Lebanoneven unto the hyssop that springeth out of the wall: he spake also ofbeasts, and of fowl, and of creeping things, and of fishes.
4:34 And there came of all people to hear the wisdom of Solomon, fromall kings of the earth, which had heard of his wisdom.
5:1 And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants unto Solomon; for he hadheard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: forHiram was ever a lover of David.
5:2 And Solomon sent to Hiram, saying, 
5:3 Thou knowest how that Davidmy father could not build an house unto the name of the LORD his Godfor the wars which were about him on every side, until the LORD putthem under the soles of his feet.
5:4 But now the LORD my God hath given me rest on every side, so thatthere is neither adversary nor evil occurrent.
5:5 And, behold, I purpose to build an house unto the name of the LORDmy God, as the LORD spake unto David my father, saying, Thy son, whomI will set upon thy throne in thy room, he shall build an house untomy name.
5:6 Now therefore command thou that they hew me cedar trees out ofLebanon; and my servants shall be with thy servants: and unto theewill I give hire for thy servants according to all that thou shaltappoint: for thou knowest that there is not among us any that canskill to hew timber like unto the Sidonians.
5:7 And it came to pass, when Hiram heard the words of Solomon, thathe rejoiced greatly, and said, Blessed be the LORD this day, whichhath given unto David a wise son over this great people.
5:8 And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have considered the thingswhich thou sentest to me for: and I will do all thy desire concerningtimber of cedar, and concerning timber of fir.
5:9 My servants shall bring them down from Lebanon unto the sea: and Iwill convey them by sea in floats unto the place that thou shaltappoint me, and will cause them to be discharged there, and thou shaltreceive them: and thou shalt accomplish my desire, in giving food formy household.
5:10 So Hiram gave Solomon cedar trees and fir trees according to allhis desire.
5:11 And Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand measures of wheat for foodto his household, and twenty measures of pure oil: thus gave Solomonto Hiram year by year.
5:12 And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and therewas peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a leaguetogether.
5:13 And king Solomon raised a levy out of all Israel; and the levywas thirty thousand men.
5:14 And he sent them to Lebanon, ten thousand a month by courses: amonth they were in Lebanon, and two months at home: and Adoniram wasover the levy.
5:15 And Solomon had threescore and ten thousand that bare burdens,and fourscore thousand hewers in the mountains; 
5:16 Beside the chiefof Solomon's officers which were over the work, three thousand andthree hundred, which ruled over the people that wrought in the work.
5:17 And the king commanded, and they brought great stones, costlystones, and hewed stones, to lay the foundation of the house.
5:18 And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and thestonesquarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.
6:1 And it came to pass in the four hundred and eightieth year afterthe children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in thefourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, in the month Zif, which isthe second month, that he began to build the house of the LORD.
6:2 And the house which king Solomon built for the LORD, the lengththereof was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof twenty cubits,and the height thereof thirty cubits.
6:3 And the porch before the temple of the house, twenty cubits wasthe length thereof, according to the breadth of the house; and tencubits was the breadth thereof before the house.
6:4 And for the house he made windows of narrow lights.
6:5 And against the wall of the house he built chambers round about,against the walls of the house round about, both of the temple and ofthe oracle: and he made chambers round about: 
6:6 The nethermostchamber was five cubits broad, and the middle was six cubits broad,and the third was seven cubits broad: for without in the wall of thehouse he made narrowed rests round about, that the beams should not befastened in the walls of the house.
6:7 And the house, when it was in building, was built of stone madeready before it was brought thither: so that there was neither hammernor axe nor any tool of iron heard in the house, while it was inbuilding.
6:8 The door for the middle chamber was in the right side of thehouse: and they went up with winding stairs into the middle chamber,and out of the middle into the third.
6:9 So he built the house, and finished it; and covered the house withbeams and boards of cedar.
6:10 And then he built chambers against all the house, five cubitshigh: and they rested on the house with timber of cedar.
6:11 And the word of the LORD came to Solomon, saying, 
6:12 Concerningthis house which thou art in building, if thou wilt walk in mystatutes, and execute my judgments, and keep all my commandments towalk in them; then will I perform my word with thee, which I spakeunto David thy father: 
6:13 And I will dwell among the children ofIsrael, and will not forsake my people Israel.
6:14 So Solomon built the house, and finished it.
6:15 And he built the walls of the house within with boards of cedar,both the floor of the house, and the walls of the ceiling: and hecovered them on the inside with wood, and covered the floor of thehouse with planks of fir.
6:16 And he built twenty cubits on the sides of the house, both thefloor and the walls with boards of cedar: he even built them for itwithin, even for the oracle, even for the most holy place.
6:17 And the house, that is, the temple before it, was forty cubitslong.
6:18 And the cedar of the house within was carved with knops and openflowers: all was cedar; there was no stone seen.
6:19 And the oracle he prepared in the house within, to set there theark of the covenant of the LORD.
6:20 And the oracle in the forepart was twenty cubits in length, andtwenty cubits in breadth, and twenty cubits in the height thereof: andhe overlaid it with pure gold; and so covered the altar which was ofcedar.
6:21 So Solomon overlaid the house within with pure gold: and he madea partition by the chains of gold before the oracle; and he overlaidit with gold.
6:22 And the whole house he overlaid with gold, until he had finishedall the house: also the whole altar that was by the oracle he overlaidwith gold.
6:23 And within the oracle he made two cherubims of olive tree, eachten cubits high.
6:24 And five cubits was the one wing of the cherub, and five cubitsthe other wing of the cherub: from the uttermost part of the one wingunto the uttermost part of the other were ten cubits.
6:25 And the other cherub was ten cubits: both the cherubims were ofone measure and one size.
6:26 The height of the one cherub was ten cubits, and so was it of theother cherub.
6:27 And he set the cherubims within the inner house: and theystretched forth the wings of the cherubims, so that the wing of theone touched the one wall, and the wing of the other cherub touched theother wall; and their wings touched one another in the midst of thehouse.
6:28 And he overlaid the cherubims with gold.
6:29 And he carved all the walls of the house round about with carvedfigures of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, within andwithout.
6:30 And the floors of the house he overlaid with gold, within andwithout.
6:31 And for the entering of the oracle he made doors of olive tree:the lintel and side posts were a fifth part of the wall.
6:32 The two doors also were of olive tree; and he carved upon themcarvings of cherubims and palm trees and open flowers, and overlaidthem with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubims, and upon the palmtrees.
6:33 So also made he for the door of the temple posts of olive tree, afourth part of the wall.
6:34 And the two doors were of fir tree: the two leaves of the onedoor were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding.
6:35 And he carved thereon cherubims and palm trees and open flowers:and covered them with gold fitted upon the carved work.
6:36 And he built the inner court with three rows of hewed stone, anda row of cedar beams.
6:37 In the fourth year was the foundation of the house of the LORDlaid, in the month Zif: 
6:38 And in the eleventh year, in the monthBul, which is the eighth month, was the house finished throughout allthe parts thereof, and according to all the fashion of it. So was heseven years in building it.
7:1 But Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and hefinished all his house.
7:2 He built also the house of the forest of Lebanon; the lengththereof was an hundred cubits, and the breadth thereof fifty cubits,and the height thereof thirty cubits, upon four rows of cedar pillars,with cedar beams upon the pillars.
7:3 And it was covered with cedar above upon the beams, that lay onforty five pillars, fifteen in a row.
7:4 And there were windows in three rows, and light was against lightin three ranks.
7:5 And all the doors and posts were square, with the windows: andlight was against light in three ranks.
7:6 And he made a porch of pillars; the length thereof was fiftycubits, and the breadth thereof thirty cubits: and the porch wasbefore them: and the other pillars and the thick beam were beforethem.
7:7 Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even theporch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of thefloor to the other.
7:8 And his house where he dwelt had another court within the porch,which was of the like work. Solomon made also an house for Pharaoh'sdaughter, whom he had taken to wife, like unto this porch.
7:9 All these were of costly stones, according to the measures ofhewed stones, sawed with saws, within and without, even from thefoundation unto the coping, and so on the outside toward the greatcourt.
7:10 And the foundation was of costly stones, even great stones,stones of ten cubits, and stones of eight cubits.
7:11 And above were costly stones, after the measures of hewed stones,and cedars.
7:12 And the great court round about was with three rows of hewedstones, and a row of cedar beams, both for the inner court of thehouse of the LORD, and for the porch of the house.
7:13 And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre.
7:14 He was a widow's son of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father wasa man of Tyre, a worker in brass: and he was filled with wisdom, andunderstanding, and cunning to work all works in brass. And he came toking Solomon, and wrought all his work.
7:15 For he cast two pillars of brass, of eighteen cubits high apiece:and a line of twelve cubits did compass either of them about.
7:16 And he made two chapiters of molten brass, to set upon the topsof the pillars: the height of the one chapiter was five cubits, andthe height of the other chapiter was five cubits: 
7:17 And nets ofchecker work, and wreaths of chain work, for the chapiters which wereupon the top of the pillars; seven for the one chapiter, and seven forthe other chapiter.
7:18 And he made the pillars, and two rows round about upon the onenetwork, to cover the chapiters that were upon the top, withpomegranates: and so did he for the other chapiter.
7:19 And the chapiters that were upon the top of the pillars were oflily work in the porch, four cubits.
7:20 And the chapiters upon the two pillars had pomegranates alsoabove, over against the belly which was by the network: and thepomegranates were two hundred in rows round about upon the otherchapiter.
7:21 And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he setup the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set upthe left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.
7:22 And upon the top of the pillars was lily work: so was the work ofthe pillars finished.
7:23 And he made a molten sea, ten cubits from the one brim to theother: it was round all about, and his height was five cubits: and aline of thirty cubits did compass it round about.
7:24 And under the brim of it round about there were knops compassingit, ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about: the knops werecast in two rows, when it was cast.
7:25 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, andthree looking toward the west, and three looking toward the south, andthree looking toward the east: and the sea was set above upon them,and all their hinder parts were inward.
7:26 And it was an hand breadth thick, and the brim thereof waswrought like the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies: it containedtwo thousand baths.
7:27 And he made ten bases of brass; four cubits was the length of onebase, and four cubits the breadth thereof, and three cubits the heightof it.
7:28 And the work of the bases was on this manner: they had borders,and the borders were between the ledges: 
7:29 And on the borders thatwere between the ledges were lions, oxen, and cherubims: and upon theledges there was a base above: and beneath the lions and oxen werecertain additions made of thin work.
7:30 And every base had four brasen wheels, and plates of brass: andthe four corners thereof had undersetters: under the laver wereundersetters molten, at the side of every addition.
7:31 And the mouth of it within the chapiter and above was a cubit:but the mouth thereof was round after the work of the base, a cubitand an half: and also upon the mouth of it were gravings with theirborders, foursquare, not round.
7:32 And under the borders were four wheels; and the axletrees of thewheels were joined to the base: and the height of a wheel was a cubitand half a cubit.
7:33 And the work of the wheels was like the work of a chariot wheel:their axletrees, and their naves, and their felloes, and their spokes,were all molten.
7:34 And there were four undersetters to the four corners of one base:and the undersetters were of the very base itself.
7:35 And in the top of the base was there a round compass of half acubit high: and on the top of the base the ledges thereof and theborders thereof were of the same.
7:36 For on the plates of the ledges thereof, and on the bordersthereof, he graved cherubims, lions, and palm trees, according to theproportion of every one, and additions round about.
7:37 After this manner he made the ten bases: all of them had onecasting, one measure, and one size.
7:38 Then made he ten lavers of brass: one laver contained fortybaths: and every laver was four cubits: and upon every one of the tenbases one laver.
7:39 And he put five bases on the right side of the house, and five onthe left side of the house: and he set the sea on the right side ofthe house eastward over against the south.
7:40 And Hiram made the lavers, and the shovels, and the basons. SoHiram made an end of doing all the work that he made king Solomon forthe house of the LORD: 
7:41 The two pillars, and the two bowls of thechapiters that were on the top of the two pillars; and the twonetworks, to cover the two bowls of the chapiters which were upon thetop of the pillars; 
7:42 And four hundred pomegranates for the twonetworks, even two rows of pomegranates for one network, to cover thetwo bowls of the chapiters that were upon the pillars; 
7:43 And theten bases, and ten lavers on the bases; 
7:44 And one sea, and twelveoxen under the sea; 
7:45 And the pots, and the shovels, and thebasons: and all these vessels, which Hiram made to king Solomon forthe house of the LORD, were of bright brass.
7:46 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay groundbetween Succoth and Zarthan.
7:47 And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because they wereexceeding many: neither was the weight of the brass found out.
7:48 And Solomon made all the vessels that pertained unto the house ofthe LORD: the altar of gold, and the table of gold, whereupon theshewbread was, 
7:49 And the candlesticks of pure gold, five on theright side, and five on the left, before the oracle, with the flowers,and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, 
7:50 And the bowls, and thesnuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the censers of puregold; and the hinges of gold, both for the doors of the inner house,the most holy place, and for the doors of the house, to wit, of thetemple.
7:51 So was ended all the work that king Solomon made for the house ofthe LORD. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father haddedicated; even the silver, and the gold, and the vessels, did he putamong the treasures of the house of the LORD.
8:1 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads ofthe tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of Israel, untoking Solomon in Jerusalem, that they might bring up the ark of thecovenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.
8:2 And all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto king Solomonat the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month.
8:3 And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up theark.
8:4 And they brought up the ark of the LORD, and the tabernacle of thecongregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the tabernacle,even those did the priests and the Levites bring up.
8:5 And king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel, that wereassembled unto him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing sheepand oxen, that could not be told nor numbered for multitude.
8:6 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORDunto his place, into the oracle of the house, to the most holy place,even under the wings of the cherubims.
8:7 For the cherubims spread forth their two wings over the place ofthe ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves thereofabove.
8:8 And they drew out the staves, that the ends of the staves wereseen out in the holy place before the oracle, and they were not seenwithout: and there they are unto this day.
8:9 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables of stone, whichMoses put there at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with thechildren of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt.
8:10 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the holyplace, that the cloud filled the house of the LORD, 
8:11 So that thepriests could not stand to minister because of the cloud: for theglory of the LORD had filled the house of the LORD.
8:12 Then spake Solomon, The LORD said that he would dwell in thethick darkness.
8:13 I have surely built thee an house to dwell in, a settled placefor thee to abide in for ever.
8:14 And the king turned his face about, and blessed all thecongregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)
8:15 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, which spake withhis mouth unto David my father, and hath with his hand fulfilled it,saying, 
8:16 Since the day that I brought forth my people Israel outof Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel to build anhouse, that my name might be therein; but I chose David to be over mypeople Israel.
8:17 And it was in the heart of David my father to build an house forthe name of the LORD God of Israel.
8:18 And the LORD said unto David my father, Whereas it was in thineheart to build an house unto my name, thou didst well that it was inthine heart.
8:19 Nevertheless thou shalt not build the house; but thy son thatshall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the house unto myname.
8:20 And the LORD hath performed his word that he spake, and I amrisen up in the room of David my father, and sit on the throne ofIsrael, as the LORD promised, and have built an house for the name ofthe LORD God of Israel.
8:21 And I have set there a place for the ark, wherein is the covenantof the LORD, which he made with our fathers, when he brought them outof the land of Egypt.
8:22 And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence ofall the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands towardheaven: 
8:23 And he said, LORD God of Israel, there is no God likethee, in heaven above, or on earth beneath, who keepest covenant andmercy with thy servants that walk before thee with all their heart:
8:24 Who hast kept with thy servant David my father that thoupromisedst him: thou spakest also with thy mouth, and hast fulfilledit with thine hand, as it is this day.
8:25 Therefore now, LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant David myfather that thou promisedst him, saying, There shall not fail thee aman in my sight to sit on the throne of Israel; so that thy childrentake heed to their way, that they walk before me as thou hast walkedbefore me.
8:26 And now, O God of Israel, let thy word, I pray thee, be verified,which thou spakest unto thy servant David my father.
8:27 But will God indeed dwell on the earth? behold, the heaven andheaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much less this house that Ihave builded?  
8:28 Yet have thou respect unto the prayer of thyservant, and to his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto thecry and to the prayer, which thy servant prayeth before thee to day:
8:29 That thine eyes may be open toward this house night and day, eventoward the place of which thou hast said, My name shall be there: thatthou mayest hearken unto the prayer which thy servant shall maketoward this place.
8:30 And hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thypeople Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear thouin heaven thy dwelling place: and when thou hearest, forgive.
8:31 If any man trespass against his neighbour, and an oath be laidupon him to cause him to swear, and the oath come before thine altarin this house: 
8:32 Then hear thou in heaven, and do, and judge thyservants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way upon his head; andjustifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.
8:33 When thy people Israel be smitten down before the enemy, becausethey have sinned against thee, and shall turn again to thee, andconfess thy name, and pray, and make supplication unto thee in thishouse: 
8:34 Then hear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thypeople Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou gavestunto their fathers.
8:35 When heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they havesinned against thee; if they pray toward this place, and confess thyname, and turn from their sin, when thou afflictest them: 
8:36 Thenhear thou in heaven, and forgive the sin of thy servants, and of thypeople Israel, that thou teach them the good way wherein they shouldwalk, and give rain upon thy land, which thou hast given to thy peoplefor an inheritance.
8:37 If there be in the land famine, if there be pestilence, blasting,mildew, locust, or if there be caterpiller; if their enemy besiegethem in the land of their cities; whatsoever plague, whatsoeversickness there be; 
8:38 What prayer and supplication soever be made byany man, or by all thy people Israel, which shall know every man theplague of his own heart, and spread forth his hands toward this house:
8:39 Then hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive, and do,and give to every man according to his ways, whose heart thou knowest;(for thou, even thou only, knowest the hearts of all the children ofmen;) 
8:40 That they may fear thee all the days that they live in theland which thou gavest unto our fathers.
8:41 Moreover concerning a stranger, that is not of thy people Israel,but cometh out of a far country for thy name's sake; 
8:42 (For theyshall hear of thy great name, and of thy strong hand, and of thystretched out arm;) when he shall come and pray toward this house;
8:43 Hear thou in heaven thy dwelling place, and do according to allthat the stranger calleth to thee for: that all people of the earthmay know thy name, to fear thee, as do thy people Israel; and thatthey may know that this house, which I have builded, is called by thyname.
8:44 If thy people go out to battle against their enemy, whithersoeverthou shalt send them, and shall pray unto the LORD toward the citywhich thou hast chosen, and toward the house that I have built for thyname: 
8:45 Then hear thou in heaven their prayer and theirsupplication, and maintain their cause.
8:46 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man that sinneth not,)and thou be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so thatthey carry them away captives unto the land of the enemy, far or near;
8:47 Yet if they shall bethink themselves in the land whither theywere carried captives, and repent, and make supplication unto thee inthe land of them that carried them captives, saying, We have sinned,and have done perversely, we have committed wickedness; 
8:48 And soreturn unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul, in theland of their enemies, which led them away captive, and pray unto theetoward their land, which thou gavest unto their fathers, the citywhich thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built for thy name:
8:49 Then hear thou their prayer and their supplication in heaven thydwelling place, and maintain their cause, 
8:50 And forgive thy peoplethat have sinned against thee, and all their transgressions whereinthey have transgressed against thee, and give them compassion beforethem who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them:
8:51 For they be thy people, and thine inheritance, which thoubroughtest forth out of Egypt, from the midst of the furnace of iron:
8:52 That thine eyes may be open unto the supplication of thy servant,and unto the supplication of thy people Israel, to hearken unto themin all that they call for unto thee.
8:53 For thou didst separate them from among all the people of theearth, to be thine inheritance, as thou spakest by the hand of Mosesthy servant, when thou broughtest our fathers out of Egypt, O LORDGod.
8:54 And it was so, that when Solomon had made an end of praying allthis prayer and supplication unto the LORD, he arose from before thealtar of the LORD, from kneeling on his knees with his hands spread upto heaven.
8:55 And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with aloud voice, saying, 
8:56 Blessed be the LORD, that hath given restunto his people Israel, according to all that he promised: there hathnot failed one word of all his good promise, which he promised by thehand of Moses his servant.
8:57 The LORD our God be with us, as he was with our fathers: let himnot leave us, nor forsake us: 
8:58 That he may incline our hearts untohim, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and hisstatutes, and his judgments, which he commanded our fathers.
8:59 And let these my words, wherewith I have made supplication beforethe LORD, be nigh unto the LORD our God day and night, that hemaintain the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israelat all times, as the matter shall require: 
8:60 That all the people ofthe earth may know that the LORD is God, and that there is none else.
8:61 Let your heart therefore be perfect with the LORD our God, towalk in his statutes, and to keep his commandments, as at this day.
8:62 And the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice beforethe LORD.
8:63 And Solomon offered a sacrifice of peace offerings, which heoffered unto the LORD, two and twenty thousand oxen, and an hundredand twenty thousand sheep. So the king and all the children of Israeldedicated the house of the LORD.
8:64 The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that wasbefore the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings,and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because thebrasen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive theburnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peaceofferings.
8:65 And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, agreat congregation, from the entering in of Hamath unto the river ofEgypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, evenfourteen days.
8:66 On the eighth day he sent the people away: and they blessed theking, and went unto their tents joyful and glad of heart for all thegoodness that the LORD had done for David his servant, and for Israelhis people.
9:1 And it came to pass, when Solomon had finished the building of thehouse of the LORD, and the king's house, and all Solomon's desirewhich he was pleased to do, 
9:2 That the LORD appeared to Solomon thesecond time, as he had appeared unto him at Gibeon.
9:3 And the LORD said unto him, I have heard thy prayer and thysupplication, that thou hast made before me: I have hallowed thishouse, which thou hast built, to put my name there for ever; and mineeyes and mine heart shall be there perpetually.
9:4 And if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy father walked, inintegrity of heart, and in uprightness, to do according to all that Ihave commanded thee, and wilt keep my statutes and my judgments: 
9:5 Then I will establish the throne of thy kingdom upon Israel for ever,as I promised to David thy father, saying, There shall not fail thee aman upon the throne of Israel.
9:6 But if ye shall at all turn from following me, ye or yourchildren, and will not keep my commandments and my statutes which Ihave set before you, but go and serve other gods, and worship them:
9:7 Then will I cut off Israel out of the land which I have giventhem; and this house, which I have hallowed for my name, will I castout of my sight; and Israel shall be a proverb and a byword among allpeople: 
9:8 And at this house, which is high, every one that passethby it shall be astonished, and shall hiss; and they shall say, Whyhath the LORD done thus unto this land, and to this house?  
9:9 Andthey shall answer, Because they forsook the LORD their God, whobrought forth their fathers out of the land of Egypt, and have takenhold upon other gods, and have worshipped them, and served them:therefore hath the LORD brought upon them all this evil.
9:10 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, when Solomon hadbuilt the two houses, the house of the LORD, and the king's house,
9:11 (Now Hiram the king of Tyre had furnished Solomon with cedartrees and fir trees, and with gold, according to all his desire,) thatthen king Solomon gave Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee.
9:12 And Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities which Solomon hadgiven him; and they pleased him not.
9:13 And he said, What cities are these which thou hast given me, mybrother? And he called them the land of Cabul unto this day.
9:14 And Hiram sent to the king sixscore talents of gold.
9:15 And this is the reason of the levy which king Solomon raised; forto build the house of the LORD, and his own house, and Millo, and thewall of Jerusalem, and Hazor, and Megiddo, and Gezer.
9:16 For Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up, and taken Gezer, and burntit with fire, and slain the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, andgiven it for a present unto his daughter, Solomon's wife.
9:17 And Solomon built Gezer, and Bethhoron the nether, 
9:18 AndBaalath, and Tadmor in the wilderness, in the land, 
9:19 And all thecities of store that Solomon had, and cities for his chariots, andcities for his horsemen, and that which Solomon desired to build inJerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion.
9:20 And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites,Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children ofIsrael, 
9:21 Their children that were left after them in the land,whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy,upon those did Solomon levy a tribute of bondservice unto this day.
9:22 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no bondmen: butthey were men of war, and his servants, and his princes, and hiscaptains, and rulers of his chariots, and his horsemen.
9:23 These were the chief of the officers that were over Solomon'swork, five hundred and fifty, which bare rule over the people thatwrought in the work.
9:24 But Pharaoh's daughter came up out of the city of David unto herhouse which Solomon had built for her: then did he build Millo.
9:25 And three times in a year did Solomon offer burnt offerings andpeace offerings upon the altar which he built unto the LORD, and heburnt incense upon the altar that was before the LORD. So he finishedthe house.
9:26 And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which isbeside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.
9:27 And Hiram sent in the navy his servants, shipmen that hadknowledge of the sea, with the servants of Solomon.
9:28 And they came to Ophir, and fetched from thence gold, fourhundred and twenty talents, and brought it to king Solomon.
10:1 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomonconcerning the name of the LORD, she came to prove him with hardquestions.
10:2 And she came to Jerusalem with a very great train, with camelsthat bare spices, and very much gold, and precious stones: and whenshe was come to Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in herheart.
10:3 And Solomon told her all her questions: there was not any thinghid from the king, which he told her not.
10:4 And when the queen of Sheba had seen all Solomon's wisdom, andthe house that he had built, 
10:5 And the meat of his table, and thesitting of his servants, and the attendance of his ministers, andtheir apparel, and his cupbearers, and his ascent by which he went upunto the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit in her.
10:6 And she said to the king, It was a true report that I heard inmine own land of thy acts and of thy wisdom.
10:7 Howbeit I believed not the words, until I came, and mine eyes hadseen it: and, behold, the half was not told me: thy wisdom andprosperity exceedeth the fame which I heard.
10:8 Happy are thy men, happy are these thy servants, which standcontinually before thee, and that hear thy wisdom.
10:9 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee, to set theeon the throne of Israel: because the LORD loved Israel for ever,therefore made he thee king, to do judgment and justice.
10:10 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, andof spices very great store, and precious stones: there came no moresuch abundance of spices as these which the queen of Sheba gave toking Solomon.
10:11 And the navy also of Hiram, that brought gold from Ophir,brought in from Ophir great plenty of almug trees, and preciousstones.
10:12 And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house ofthe LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries forsingers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen unto this day.
10:13 And king Solomon gave unto the queen of Sheba all her desire,whatsoever she asked, beside that which Solomon gave her of his royalbounty.So she turned and went to her own country, she and her servants.
10:14 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was sixhundred threescore and six talents of gold, 
10:15 Beside that he hadof the merchantmen, and of the traffick of the spice merchants, and ofall the kings of Arabia, and of the governors of the country.
10:16 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: sixhundred shekels of gold went to one target.
10:17 And he made three hundred shields of beaten gold; three pound ofgold went to one shield: and the king put them in the house of theforest of Lebanon.
10:18 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid itwith the best gold.
10:19 The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was roundbehind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat,and two lions stood beside the stays.
10:20 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the otherupon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.
10:21 And all king Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and allthe vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of pure gold;none were of silver: it was nothing accounted of in the days ofSolomon.
10:22 For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy ofHiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold,and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.
10:23 So king Solomon exceeded all the kings of the earth for richesand for wisdom.
10:24 And all the earth sought to Solomon, to hear his wisdom, whichGod had put in his heart.
10:25 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, andvessels of gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, andmules, a rate year by year.
10:26 And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen: and he hada thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,whom he bestowed in the cities for chariots, and with the king atJerusalem.
10:27 And the king made silver to be in Jerusalem as stones, andcedars made he to be as the sycomore trees that are in the vale, forabundance.
10:28 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn: theking's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.
10:29 And a chariot came up and went out of Egypt for six hundredshekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred and fifty: and so forall the kings of the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, did theybring them out by their means.
11:1 But king Solomon loved many strange women, together with thedaughter of Pharaoh, women of the Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites,Zidonians, and Hittites: 
11:2 Of the nations concerning which the LORDsaid unto the children of Israel, Ye shall not go in to them, neithershall they come in unto you: for surely they will turn away your heartafter their gods: Solomon clave unto these in love.
11:3 And he had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundredconcubines: and his wives turned away his heart.
11:4 For it came to pass, when Solomon was old, that his wives turnedaway his heart after other gods: and his heart was not perfect withthe LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.
11:5 For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians,and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.
11:6 And Solomon did evil in the sight of the LORD, and went not fullyafter the LORD, as did David his father.
11:7 Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abominationof Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, theabomination of the children of Ammon.
11:8 And likewise did he for all his strange wives, which burntincense and sacrificed unto their gods.
11:9 And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart was turnedfrom the LORD God of Israel, which had appeared unto him twice, 
11:10 And had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not goafter other gods: but he kept not that which the LORD commanded.
11:11 Wherefore the LORD said unto Solomon, Forasmuch as this is doneof thee, and thou hast not kept my covenant and my statutes, which Ihave commanded thee, I will surely rend the kingdom from thee, andwill give it to thy servant.
11:12 Notwithstanding in thy days I will not do it for David thyfather's sake: but I will rend it out of the hand of thy son.
11:13 Howbeit I will not rend away all the kingdom; but will give onetribe to thy son for David my servant's sake, and for Jerusalem's sakewhich I have chosen.
11:14 And the LORD stirred up an adversary unto Solomon, Hadad theEdomite: he was of the king's seed in Edom.
11:15 For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab thecaptain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he hadsmitten every male in Edom; 
11:16 (For six months did Joab remainthere with all Israel, until he had cut off every male in Edom:) 
11:17 That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants withhim, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.
11:18 And they arose out of Midian, and came to Paran: and they tookmen with them out of Paran, and they came to Egypt, unto Pharaoh kingof Egypt; which gave him an house, and appointed him victuals, andgave him land.
11:19 And Hadad found great favour in the sight of Pharaoh, so that hegave him to wife the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenesthe queen.
11:20 And the sister of Tahpenes bare him Genubath his son, whomTahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's house: and Genubath was in Pharaoh'shousehold among the sons of Pharaoh.
11:21 And when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers,and that Joab the captain of the host was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh,Let me depart, that I may go to mine own country.
11:22 Then Pharaoh said unto him, But what hast thou lacked with me,that, behold, thou seekest to go to thine own country? And heanswered, Nothing: howbeit let me go in any wise.
11:23 And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son ofEliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah: 
11:24 Andhe gathered men unto him, and became captain over a band, when Davidslew them of Zobah: and they went to Damascus, and dwelt therein, andreigned in Damascus.
11:25 And he was an adversary to Israel all the days of Solomon,beside the mischief that Hadad did: and he abhorred Israel, andreigned over Syria.
11:26 And Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephrathite of Zereda,Solomon's servant, whose mother's name was Zeruah, a widow woman, evenhe lifted up his hand against the king.
11:27 And this was the cause that he lifted up his hand against theking: Solomon built Millo, and repaired the breaches of the city ofDavid his father.
11:28 And the man Jeroboam was a mighty man of valour: and Solomonseeing the young man that he was industrious, he made him ruler overall the charge of the house of Joseph.
11:29 And it came to pass at that time when Jeroboam went out ofJerusalem, that the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him in the way;and he had clad himself with a new garment; and they two were alone inthe field: 
11:30 And Ahijah caught the new garment that was on him,and rent it in twelve pieces: 
11:31 And he said to Jeroboam, Take theeten pieces: for thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, Behold, I willrend the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon, and will give ten tribesto thee: 
11:32 (But he shall have one tribe for my servant David'ssake, and for Jerusalem's sake, the city which I have chosen out ofall the tribes of Israel:) 
11:33 Because that they have forsaken me,and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemoshthe god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon,and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in mineeyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David hisfather.
11:34 Howbeit I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand: but Iwill make him prince all the days of his life for David my servant'ssake, whom I chose, because he kept my commandments and my statutes:
11:35 But I will take the kingdom out of his son's hand, and will giveit unto thee, even ten tribes.
11:36 And unto his son will I give one tribe, that David my servantmay have a light alway before me in Jerusalem, the city which I havechosen me to put my name there.
11:37 And I will take thee, and thou shalt reign according to all thatthy soul desireth, and shalt be king over Israel.
11:38 And it shall be, if thou wilt hearken unto all that I commandthee, and wilt walk in my ways, and do that is right in my sight, tokeep my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did; that Iwill be with thee, and build thee a sure house, as I built for David,and will give Israel unto thee.
11:39 And I will for this afflict the seed of David, but not for ever.
11:40 Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. And Jeroboam arose,and fled into Egypt, unto Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egyptuntil the death of Solomon.
11:41 And the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, andhis wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?
11:42 And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israelwas forty years.
11:43 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and was buried in the cityof David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his stead.
12:1 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for all Israel were come to Shechemto make him king.
12:2 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was yetin Egypt, heard of it, (for he was fled from the presence of kingSolomon, and Jeroboam dwelt in Egypt;) 
12:3 That they sent and calledhim. And Jeroboam and all the congregation of Israel came, and spakeunto Rehoboam, saying, 
12:4 Thy father made our yoke grievous: nowtherefore make thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavyyoke which he put upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.
12:5 And he said unto them, Depart yet for three days, then come againto me. And the people departed.
12:6 And king Rehoboam consulted with the old men, that stood beforeSolomon his father while he yet lived, and said, How do ye advise thatI may answer this people?  
12:7 And they spake unto him, saying, Ifthou wilt be a servant unto this people this day, and wilt serve them,and answer them, and speak good words to them, then they will be thyservants for ever.
12:8 But he forsook the counsel of the old men, which they had givenhim, and consulted with the young men that were grown up with him, andwhich stood before him: 
12:9 And he said unto them, What counsel giveye that we may answer this people, who have spoken to me, saying, Makethe yoke which thy father did put upon us lighter?  
12:10 And theyoung men that were grown up with him spake unto him, saying, Thusshalt thou speak unto this people that spake unto thee, saying, Thyfather made our yoke heavy, but make thou it lighter unto us; thusshalt thou say unto them, My little finger shall be thicker than myfather's loins.
12:11 And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I willadd to your yoke: my father hath chastised you with whips, but I willchastise you with scorpions.
12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day,as the king had appointed, saying, Come to me again the third day.
12:13 And the king answered the people roughly, and forsook the oldmen's counsel that they gave him; 
12:14 And spake to them after thecounsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, andI will add to your yoke: my father also chastised you with whips, butI will chastise you with scorpions.
12:15 Wherefore the king hearkened not unto the people; for the causewas from the LORD, that he might perform his saying, which the LORDspake by Ahijah the Shilonite unto Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
12:16 So when all Israel saw that the king hearkened not unto them,the people answered the king, saying, What portion have we in David?neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents, OIsrael: now see to thine own house, David. So Israel departed untotheir tents.
12:17 But as for the children of Israel which dwelt in the cities ofJudah, Rehoboam reigned over them.
12:18 Then king Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was over the tribute; andall Israel stoned him with stones, that he died. Therefore kingRehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to flee toJerusalem.
12:19 So Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.
12:20 And it came to pass, when all Israel heard that Jeroboam wascome again, that they sent and called him unto the congregation, andmade him king over all Israel: there was none that followed the houseof David, but the tribe of Judah only.
12:21 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he assembled all thehouse of Judah, with the tribe of Benjamin, an hundred and fourscorethousand chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against the houseof Israel, to bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam the son of Solomon.
12:22 But the word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, saying,
12:23 Speak unto Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and untoall the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people,saying, 
12:24 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fightagainst your brethren the children of Israel: return every man to hishouse; for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the wordof the LORD, and returned to depart, according to the word of theLORD.
12:25 Then Jeroboam built Shechem in mount Ephraim, and dwelt therein;and went out from thence, and built Penuel.
12:26 And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return tothe house of David: 
12:27 If this people go up to do sacrifice in thehouse of the LORD at Jerusalem, then shall the heart of this peopleturn again unto their lord, even unto Rehoboam king of Judah, and theyshall kill me, and go again to Rehoboam king of Judah.
12:28 Whereupon the king took counsel, and made two calves of gold,and said unto them, It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem:behold thy gods, O Israel, which brought thee up out of the land ofEgypt.
12:29 And he set the one in Bethel, and the other put he in Dan.
12:30 And this thing became a sin: for the people went to worshipbefore the one, even unto Dan.
12:31 And he made an house of high places, and made priests of thelowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.
12:32 And Jeroboam ordained a feast in the eighth month, on thefifteenth day of the month, like unto the feast that is in Judah, andhe offered upon the altar. So did he in Bethel, sacrificing unto thecalves that he had made: and he placed in Bethel the priests of thehigh places which he had made.
12:33 So he offered upon the altar which he had made in Bethel thefifteenth day of the eighth month, even in the month which he haddevised of his own heart; and ordained a feast unto the children ofIsrael: and he offered upon the altar, and burnt incense.
13:1 And, behold, there came a man of God out of Judah by the word ofthe LORD unto Bethel: and Jeroboam stood by the altar to burn incense.
13:2 And he cried against the altar in the word of the LORD, and said,O altar, altar, thus saith the LORD; Behold, a child shall be bornunto the house of David, Josiah by name; and upon thee shall he offerthe priests of the high places that burn incense upon thee, and men'sbones shall be burnt upon thee.
13:3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign whichthe LORD hath spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashesthat are upon it shall be poured out.
13:4 And it came to pass, when king Jeroboam heard the saying of theman of God, which had cried against the altar in Bethel, that he putforth his hand from the altar, saying, Lay hold on him. And his hand,which he put forth against him, dried up, so that he could not pull itin again to him.
13:5 The altar also was rent, and the ashes poured out from the altar,according to the sign which the man of God had given by the word ofthe LORD.
13:6 And the king answered and said unto the man of God, Intreat nowthe face of the LORD thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may berestored me again. And the man of God besought the LORD, and theking's hand was restored him again, and became as it was before.
13:7 And the king said unto the man of God, Come home with me, andrefresh thyself, and I will give thee a reward.
13:8 And the man of God said unto the king, If thou wilt give me halfthine house, I will not go in with thee, neither will I eat bread nordrink water in this place: 
13:9 For so was it charged me by the wordof the LORD, saying, Eat no bread, nor drink water, nor turn again bythe same way that thou camest.
13:10 So he went another way, and returned not by the way that he cameto Bethel.
13:11 Now there dwelt an old prophet in Bethel; and his sons came andtold him all the works that the man of God had done that day inBethel: the words which he had spoken unto the king, them they toldalso to their father.
13:12 And their father said unto them, What way went he? For his sonshad seen what way the man of God went, which came from Judah.
13:13 And he said unto his sons, Saddle me the ass. So they saddledhim the ass: and he rode thereon, 
13:14 And went after the man of God,and found him sitting under an oak: and he said unto him, Art thou theman of God that camest from Judah? And he said, I am.
13:15 Then he said unto him, Come home with me, and eat bread.
13:16 And he said, I may not return with thee, nor go in with thee:neither will I eat bread nor drink water with thee in this place:
13:17 For it was said to me by the word of the LORD, Thou shalt eat nobread nor drink water there, nor turn again to go by the way that thoucamest.
13:18 He said unto him, I am a prophet also as thou art; and an angelspake unto me by the word of the LORD, saying, Bring him back withthee into thine house, that he may eat bread and drink water. But helied unto him.
13:19 So he went back with him, and did eat bread in his house, anddrank water.
13:20 And it came to pass, as they sat at the table, that the word ofthe LORD came unto the prophet that brought him back: 
13:21 And hecried unto the man of God that came from Judah, saying, Thus saith theLORD, Forasmuch as thou hast disobeyed the mouth of the LORD, and hastnot kept the commandment which the LORD thy God commanded thee, 
13:22 But camest back, and hast eaten bread and drunk water in the place, ofthe which the Lord did say to thee, Eat no bread, and drink no water;thy carcase shall not come unto the sepulchre of thy fathers.
13:23 And it came to pass, after he had eaten bread, and after he haddrunk, that he saddled for him the ass, to wit, for the prophet whomhe had brought back.
13:24 And when he was gone, a lion met him by the way, and slew him:and his carcase was cast in the way, and the ass stood by it, the lionalso stood by the carcase.
13:25 And, behold, men passed by, and saw the carcase cast in the way,and the lion standing by the carcase: and they came and told it in thecity where the old prophet dwelt.
13:26 And when the prophet that brought him back from the way heardthereof, he said, It is the man of God, who was disobedient unto theword of the LORD: therefore the LORD hath delivered him unto the lion,which hath torn him, and slain him, according to the word of the LORD,which he spake unto him.
13:27 And he spake to his sons, saying, Saddle me the ass. And theysaddled him.
13:28 And he went and found his carcase cast in the way, and the assand the lion standing by the carcase: the lion had not eaten thecarcase, nor torn the ass.
13:29 And the prophet took up the carcase of the man of God, and laidit upon the ass, and brought it back: and the old prophet came to thecity, to mourn and to bury him.
13:30 And he laid his carcase in his own grave; and they mourned overhim, saying, Alas, my brother!  
13:31 And it came to pass, after hehad buried him, that he spake to his sons, saying, When I am dead,then bury me in the sepulchre wherein the man of God is buried; lay mybones beside his bones: 
13:32 For the saying which he cried by theword of the LORD against the altar in Bethel, and against all thehouses of the high places which are in the cities of Samaria, shallsurely come to pass.
13:33 After this thing Jeroboam returned not from his evil way, butmade again of the lowest of the people priests of the high places:whosoever would, he consecrated him, and he became one of the priestsof the high places.
13:34 And this thing became sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even tocut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the earth.
14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.
14:2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, I pray thee, and disguisethyself, that thou be not known to be the wife of Jeroboam; and getthee to Shiloh: behold, there is Ahijah the prophet, which told methat I should be king over this people.
14:3 And take with thee ten loaves, and cracknels, and a cruse ofhoney, and go to him: he shall tell thee what shall become of thechild.
14:4 And Jeroboam's wife did so, and arose, and went to Shiloh, andcame to the house of Ahijah. But Ahijah could not see; for his eyeswere set by reason of his age.
14:5 And the LORD said unto Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboamcometh to ask a thing of thee for her son; for he is sick: thus andthus shalt thou say unto her: for it shall be, when she cometh in,that she shall feign herself to be another woman.
14:6 And it was so, when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as shecame in at the door, that he said, Come in, thou wife of Jeroboam; whyfeignest thou thyself to be another? for I am sent to thee with heavytidings.
14:7 Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Forasmuchas I exalted thee from among the people, and made thee prince over mypeople Israel, 
14:8 And rent the kingdom away from the house of David,and gave it thee: and yet thou hast not been as my servant David, whokept my commandments, and who followed me with all his heart, to dothat only which was right in mine eyes; 
14:9 But hast done evil aboveall that were before thee: for thou hast gone and made thee othergods, and molten images, to provoke me to anger, and hast cast mebehind thy back: 
14:10 Therefore, behold, I will bring evil upon thehouse of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam him that pissethagainst the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, and willtake away the remnant of the house of Jeroboam, as a man taketh awaydung, till it be all gone.
14:11 Him that dieth of Jeroboam in the city shall the dogs eat; andhim that dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat: for theLORD hath spoken it.
14:12 Arise thou therefore, get thee to thine own house: and when thyfeet enter into the city, the child shall die.
14:13 And all Israel shall mourn for him, and bury him: for he only ofJeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found somegood thing toward the LORD God of Israel in the house of Jeroboam.
14:14 Moreover the LORD shall raise him up a king over Israel, whoshall cut off the house of Jeroboam that day: but what? even now.
14:15 For the LORD shall smite Israel, as a reed is shaken in thewater, and he shall root up Israel out of this good land, which hegave to their fathers, and shall scatter them beyond the river,because they have made their groves, provoking the LORD to anger.
14:16 And he shall give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, whodid sin, and who made Israel to sin.
14:17 And Jeroboam's wife arose, and departed, and came to Tirzah: andwhen she came to the threshold of the door, the child died; 
14:18 Andthey buried him; and all Israel mourned for him, according to the wordof the LORD, which he spake by the hand of his servant Ahijah theprophet.
14:19 And the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred, and how hereigned, behold, they are written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of Israel.
14:20 And the days which Jeroboam reigned were two and twenty years:and he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his stead.
14:21 And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam wasforty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reignedseventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose outof all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother'sname was Naamah an Ammonitess.
14:22 And Judah did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they provokedhim to jealousy with their sins which they had committed, above allthat their fathers had done.
14:23 For they also built them high places, and images, and groves, onevery high hill, and under every green tree.
14:24 And there were also sodomites in the land: and they didaccording to all the abominations of the nations which the LORD castout before the children of Israel.
14:25 And it came to pass in the fifth year of king Rehoboam, thatShishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem: 
14:26 And he tookaway the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of theking's house; he even took away all: and he took away all the shieldsof gold which Solomon had made.
14:27 And king Rehoboam made in their stead brasen shields, andcommitted them unto the hands of the chief of the guard, which keptthe door of the king's house.
14:28 And it was so, when the king went into the house of the LORD,that the guard bare them, and brought them back into the guardchamber.
14:29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam, and all that he did, arethey not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?
14:30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all their days.
14:31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried with hisfathers in the city of David. And his mother's name was Naamah anAmmonitess. And Abijam his son reigned in his stead.
15:1 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam the son of Nebatreigned Abijam over Judah.
15:2 Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name wasMaachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
15:3 And he walked in all the sins of his father, which he had donebefore him: and his heart was not perfect with the LORD his God, asthe heart of David his father.
15:4 Nevertheless for David's sake did the LORD his God give him alamp in Jerusalem, to set up his son after him, and to establishJerusalem: 
15:5 Because David did that which was right in the eyes ofthe LORD, and turned not aside from any thing that he commanded himall the days of his life, save only in the matter of Uriah theHittite.
15:6 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days ofhis life.
15:7 Now the rest of the acts of Abijam, and all that he did, are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Andthere was war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
15:8 And Abijam slept with his fathers; and they buried him in thecity of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead.
15:9 And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asaover Judah.
15:10 And forty and one years reigned he in Jerusalem. And hismother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.
15:11 And Asa did that which was right in the eyes of the LORD, as didDavid his father.
15:12 And he took away the sodomites out of the land, and removed allthe idols that his fathers had made.
15:13 And also Maachah his mother, even her he removed from beingqueen, because she had made an idol in a grove; and Asa destroyed heridol, and burnt it by the brook Kidron.
15:14 But the high places were not removed: nevertheless Asa's heartwas perfect with the LORD all his days.
15:15 And he brought in the things which his father had dedicated, andthe things which himself had dedicated, into the house of the LORD,silver, and gold, and vessels.
15:16 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel alltheir days.
15:17 And Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah, and builtRamah, that he might not suffer any to go out or come in to Asa kingof Judah.
15:18 Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in thetreasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king'shouse, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asasent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king ofSyria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying, 
15:19 There is a league betweenme and thee, and between my father and thy father: behold, I have sentunto thee a present of silver and gold; come and break thy league withBaasha king of Israel, that he may depart from me.
15:20 So Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains ofthe hosts which he had against the cities of Israel, and smote Ijon,and Dan, and Abelbethmaachah, and all Cinneroth, with all the land ofNaphtali.
15:21 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard thereof, that he left offbuilding of Ramah, and dwelt in Tirzah.
15:22 Then king Asa made a proclamation throughout all Judah; none wasexempted: and they took away the stones of Ramah, and the timberthereof, wherewith Baasha had builded; and king Asa built with themGeba of Benjamin, and Mizpah.
15:23 The rest of all the acts of Asa, and all his might, and all thathe did, and the cities which he built, are they not written in thebook of the chronicles of the kings of Judah? Nevertheless in the timeof his old age he was diseased in his feet.
15:24 And Asa slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathersin the city of David his father: and Jehoshaphat his son reigned inhis stead.
15:25 And Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in thesecond year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned over Israel two years.
15:26 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the wayof his father, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
15:27 And Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar,conspired against him; and Baasha smote him at Gibbethon, whichbelonged to the Philistines; for Nadab and all Israel laid siege toGibbethon.
15:28 Even in the third year of Asa king of Judah did Baasha slay him,and reigned in his stead.
15:29 And it came to pass, when he reigned, that he smote all thehouse of Jeroboam; he left not to Jeroboam any that breathed, until hehad destroyed him, according unto the saying of the LORD, which hespake by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite: 
15:30 Because of the sinsof Jeroboam which he sinned, and which he made Israel sin, by hisprovocation wherewith he provoked the LORD God of Israel to anger.
15:31 Now the rest of the acts of Nadab, and all that he did, are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
15:32 And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel alltheir days.
15:33 In the third year of Asa king of Judah began Baasha the son ofAhijah to reign over all Israel in Tirzah, twenty and four years.
15:34 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the wayof Jeroboam, and in his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin.
16:1 Then the word of the LORD came to Jehu the son of Hanani againstBaasha, saying, 
16:2 Forasmuch as I exalted thee out of the dust, andmade thee prince over my people Israel; and thou hast walked in theway of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, to provoke meto anger with their sins; 
16:3 Behold, I will take away the posterityof Baasha, and the posterity of his house; and will make thy houselike the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat.
16:4 Him that dieth of Baasha in the city shall the dogs eat; and himthat dieth of his in the fields shall the fowls of the air eat.
16:5 Now the rest of the acts of Baasha, and what he did, and hismight, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kingsof Israel?  
16:6 So Baasha slept with his fathers, and was buried inTirzah: and Elah his son reigned in his stead.
16:7 And also by the hand of the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani camethe word of the LORD against Baasha, and against his house, even forall the evil that he did in the sight of the LORD, in provoking him toanger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam;and because he killed him.
16:8 In the twenty and sixth year of Asa king of Judah began Elah theson of Baasha to reign over Israel in Tirzah, two years.
16:9 And his servant Zimri, captain of half his chariots, conspiredagainst him, as he was in Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the houseof Arza steward of his house in Tirzah.
16:10 And Zimri went in and smote him, and killed him, in the twentyand seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his stead.
16:11 And it came to pass, when he began to reign, as soon as he saton his throne, that he slew all the house of Baasha: he left him notone that pisseth against a wall, neither of his kinsfolks, nor of hisfriends.
16:12 Thus did Zimri destroy all the house of Baasha, according to theword of the LORD, which he spake against Baasha by Jehu the prophet.
16:13 For all the sins of Baasha, and the sins of Elah his son, bywhich they sinned, and by which they made Israel to sin, in provokingthe LORD God of Israel to anger with their vanities.
16:14 Now the rest of the acts of Elah, and all that he did, are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
16:15 In the twenty and seventh year of Asa king of Judah did Zimrireign seven days in Tirzah. And the people were encamped againstGibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines.
16:16 And the people that were encamped heard say, Zimri hathconspired, and hath also slain the king: wherefore all Israel madeOmri, the captain of the host, king over Israel that day in the camp.
16:17 And Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, andthey besieged Tirzah.
16:18 And it came to pass, when Zimri saw that the city was taken,that he went into the palace of the king's house, and burnt the king'shouse over him with fire, and died.
16:19 For his sins which he sinned in doing evil in the sight of theLORD, in walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin which he did,to make Israel to sin.
16:20 Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and his treason that hewrought, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of thekings of Israel?  
16:21 Then were the people of Israel divided intotwo parts: half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, tomake him king; and half followed Omri.
16:22 But the people that followed Omri prevailed against the peoplethat followed Tibni the son of Ginath: so Tibni died, and Omrireigned.
16:23 In the thirty and first year of Asa king of Judah began Omri toreign over Israel, twelve years: six years reigned he in Tirzah.
16:24 And he bought the hill Samaria of Shemer for two talents ofsilver, and built on the hill, and called the name of the city whichhe built, after the name of Shemer, owner of the hill, Samaria.
16:25 But Omri wrought evil in the eyes of the LORD, and did worsethan all that were before him.
16:26 For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, andin his sin wherewith he made Israel to sin, to provoke the LORD God ofIsrael to anger with their vanities.
16:27 Now the rest of the acts of Omri which he did, and his mightthat he shewed, are they not written in the book of the chronicles ofthe kings of Israel?  
16:28 So Omri slept with his fathers, and wasburied in Samaria: and Ahab his son reigned in his stead.
16:29 And in the thirty and eighth year of Asa king of Judah beganAhab the son of Omri to reign over Israel: and Ahab the son of Omrireigned over Israel in Samaria twenty and two years.
16:30 And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the LORD aboveall that were before him.
16:31 And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him towalk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wifeJezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went andserved Baal, and worshipped him.
16:32 And he reared up an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, whichhe had built in Samaria.
16:33 And Ahab made a grove; and Ahab did more to provoke the LORD Godof Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him.
16:34 In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid thefoundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gatesthereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD,which he spake by Joshua the son of Nun.
17:1 And Elijah the Tishbite, who was of the inhabitants of Gilead,said unto Ahab, As the LORD God of Israel liveth, before whom I stand,there shall not be dew nor rain these years, but according to my word.
17:2 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
17:3 Get theehence, and turn thee eastward, and hide thyself by the brook Cherith,that is before Jordan.
17:4 And it shall be, that thou shalt drink of the brook; and I havecommanded the ravens to feed thee there.
17:5 So he went and did according unto the word of the LORD: for hewent and dwelt by the brook Cherith, that is before Jordan.
17:6 And the ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, andbread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.
17:7 And it came to pass after a while, that the brook dried up,because there had been no rain in the land.
17:8 And the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, 
17:9 Arise, getthee to Zarephath, which belongeth to Zidon, and dwell there: behold,I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee.
17:10 So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gateof the city, behold, the widow woman was there gathering of sticks:and he called to her, and said, Fetch me, I pray thee, a little waterin a vessel, that I may drink.
17:11 And as she was going to fetch it, he called to her, and said,Bring me, I pray thee, a morsel of bread in thine hand.
17:12 And she said, As the LORD thy God liveth, I have not a cake, butan handful of meal in a barrel, and a little oil in a cruse: and,behold, I am gathering two sticks, that I may go in and dress it forme and my son, that we may eat it, and die.
17:13 And Elijah said unto her, Fear not; go and do as thou hast said:but make me thereof a little cake first, and bring it unto me, andafter make for thee and for thy son.
17:14 For thus saith the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shallnot waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that theLORD sendeth rain upon the earth.
17:15 And she went and did according to the saying of Elijah: and she,and he, and her house, did eat many days.
17:16 And the barrel of meal wasted not, neither did the cruse of oilfail, according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by Elijah.
17:17 And it came to pass after these things, that the son of thewoman, the mistress of the house, fell sick; and his sickness was sosore, that there was no breath left in him.
17:18 And she said unto Elijah, What have I to do with thee, O thouman of God? art thou come unto me to call my sin to remembrance, andto slay my son?  
17:19 And he said unto her, Give me thy son. And hetook him out of her bosom, and carried him up into a loft, where heabode, and laid him upon his own bed.
17:20 And he cried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, hast thoualso brought evil upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by slaying herson?  
17:21 And he stretched himself upon the child three times, andcried unto the LORD, and said, O LORD my God, I pray thee, let thischild's soul come into him again.
17:22 And the LORD heard the voice of Elijah; and the soul of thechild came into him again, and he revived.
17:23 And Elijah took the child, and brought him down out of thechamber into the house, and delivered him unto his mother: and Elijahsaid, See, thy son liveth.
17:24 And the woman said to Elijah, Now by this I know that thou art aman of God, and that the word of the LORD in thy mouth is truth.
18:1 And it came to pass after many days, that the word of the LORDcame to Elijah in the third year, saying, Go, shew thyself unto Ahab;and I will send rain upon the earth.
18:2 And Elijah went to shew himself unto Ahab. And there was a sorefamine in Samaria.
18:3 And Ahab called Obadiah, which was the governor of his house.(Now Obadiah feared the LORD greatly: 
18:4 For it was so, when Jezebelcut off the prophets of the LORD, that Obadiah took an hundredprophets, and hid them by fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread andwater.)  
18:5 And Ahab said unto Obadiah, Go into the land, unto allfountains of water, and unto all brooks: peradventure we may findgrass to save the horses and mules alive, that we lose not all thebeasts.
18:6 So they divided the land between them to pass throughout it: Ahabwent one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
18:7 And as Obadiah was in the way, behold, Elijah met him: and heknew him, and fell on his face, and said, Art thou that my lordElijah?  
18:8 And he answered him, I am: go, tell thy lord, Behold,Elijah is here.
18:9 And he said, What have I sinned, that thou wouldest deliver thyservant into the hand of Ahab, to slay me?  
18:10 As the LORD thy Godliveth, there is no nation or kingdom, whither my lord hath not sentto seek thee: and when they said, He is not there; he took an oath ofthe kingdom and nation, that they found thee not.
18:11 And now thou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here.
18:12 And it shall come to pass, as soon as I am gone from thee, thatthe Spirit of the LORD shall carry thee whither I know not; and sowhen I come and tell Ahab, and he cannot find thee, he shall slay me:but I thy servant fear the LORD from my youth.
18:13 Was it not told my lord what I did when Jezebel slew theprophets of the LORD, how I hid an hundred men of the LORD's prophetsby fifty in a cave, and fed them with bread and water?  
18:14 And nowthou sayest, Go, tell thy lord, Behold, Elijah is here: and he shallslay me.
18:15 And Elijah said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom Istand, I will surely shew myself unto him to day.
18:16 So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him: and Ahab went tomeet Elijah.
18:17 And it came to pass, when Ahab saw Elijah, that Ahab said untohim, Art thou he that troubleth Israel?  
18:18 And he answered, I havenot troubled Israel; but thou, and thy father's house, in that ye haveforsaken the commandments of the LORD, and thou hast followed Baalim.
18:19 Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel unto mountCarmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and theprophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.
18:20 So Ahab sent unto all the children of Israel, and gathered theprophets together unto mount Carmel.
18:21 And Elijah came unto all the people, and said, How long halt yebetween two opinions? if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal,then follow him. And the people answered him not a word.
18:22 Then said Elijah unto the people, I, even I only, remain aprophet of the LORD; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fiftymen.
18:23 Let them therefore give us two bullocks; and let them choose onebullock for themselves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, andput no fire under: and I will dress the other bullock, and lay it onwood, and put no fire under: 
18:24 And call ye on the name of yourgods, and I will call on the name of the LORD: and the God thatanswereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people answered andsaid, It is well spoken.
18:25 And Elijah said unto the prophets of Baal, Choose you onebullock for yourselves, and dress it first; for ye are many; and callon the name of your gods, but put no fire under.
18:26 And they took the bullock which was given them, and they dressedit, and called on the name of Baal from morning even until noon,saying, O Baal, hear us. But there was no voice, nor any thatanswered. And they leaped upon the altar which was made.
18:27 And it came to pass at noon, that Elijah mocked them, and said,Cry aloud: for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is pursuing,or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth, and must beawaked.
18:28 And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner withknives and lancets, till the blood gushed out upon them.
18:29 And it came to pass, when midday was past, and they prophesieduntil the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice, that therewas neither voice, nor any to answer, nor any that regarded.
18:30 And Elijah said unto all the people, Come near unto me. And allthe people came near unto him. And he repaired the altar of the LORDthat was broken down.
18:31 And Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of thetribes of the sons of Jacob, unto whom the word of the LORD came,saying, Israel shall be thy name: 
18:32 And with the stones he builtan altar in the name of the LORD: and he made a trench about thealtar, as great as would contain two measures of seed.
18:33 And he put the wood in order, and cut the bullock in pieces, andlaid him on the wood, and said, Fill four barrels with water, and pourit on the burnt sacrifice, and on the wood.
18:34 And he said, Do it the second time. And they did it the secondtime.And he said, Do it the third time. And they did it the third time.
18:35 And the water ran round about the altar; and he filled thetrench also with water.
18:36 And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the eveningsacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and said, LORD God ofAbraham, Isaac, and of Israel, let it be known this day that thou artGod in Israel, and that I am thy servant, and that I have done allthese things at thy word.
18:37 Hear me, O LORD, hear me, that this people may know that thouart the LORD God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again.
18:38 Then the fire of the LORD fell, and consumed the burntsacrifice, and the wood, and the stones, and the dust, and licked upthe water that was in the trench.
18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces: andthey said, The LORD, he is the God; the LORD, he is the God.
18:40 And Elijah said unto them, Take the prophets of Baal; let notone of them escape. And they took them: and Elijah brought them downto the brook Kishon, and slew them there.
18:41 And Elijah said unto Ahab, Get thee up, eat and drink; for thereis a sound of abundance of rain.
18:42 So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to thetop of Carmel; and he cast himself down upon the earth, and put hisface between his knees, 
18:43 And said to his servant, Go up now, looktoward the sea. And he went up, and looked, and said, There isnothing. And he said, Go again seven times.
18:44 And it came to pass at the seventh time, that he said, Behold,there ariseth a little cloud out of the sea, like a man's hand. And hesaid, Go up, say unto Ahab, Prepare thy chariot, and get thee downthat the rain stop thee not.
18:45 And it came to pass in the mean while, that the heaven was blackwith clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode, andwent to Jezreel.
18:46 And the hand of the LORD was on Elijah; and he girded up hisloins, and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel.
19:1 And Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and withal how hehad slain all the prophets with the sword.
19:2 Then Jezebel sent a messenger unto Elijah, saying, So let thegods do to me, and more also, if I make not thy life as the life ofone of them by to morrow about this time.
19:3 And when he saw that, he arose, and went for his life, and cameto Beersheba, which belongeth to Judah, and left his servant there.
19:4 But he himself went a day's journey into the wilderness, and cameand sat down under a juniper tree: and he requested for himself thathe might die; and said, It is enough; now, O LORD, take away my life;for I am not better than my fathers.
19:5 And as he lay and slept under a juniper tree, behold, then anangel touched him, and said unto him, Arise and eat.
19:6 And he looked, and, behold, there was a cake baken on the coals,and a cruse of water at his head. And he did eat and drink, and laidhim down again.
19:7 And the angel of the LORD came again the second time, and touchedhim, and said, Arise and eat; because the journey is too great forthee.
19:8 And he arose, and did eat and drink, and went in the strength ofthat meat forty days and forty nights unto Horeb the mount of God.
19:9 And he came thither unto a cave, and lodged there; and, behold,the word of the LORD came to him, and he said unto him, What doestthou here, Elijah?  
19:10 And he said, I have been very jealous forthe LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken thycovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with thesword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take itaway.
19:11 And he said, Go forth, and stand upon the mount before the LORD.And, behold, the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent themountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORDwas not in the wind: and after the wind an earthquake; but the LORDwas not in the earthquake: 
19:12 And after the earthquake a fire; butthe LORD was not in the fire: and after the fire a still small voice.
19:13 And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face inhis mantle, and went out, and stood in the entering in of the cave.And, behold, there came a voice unto him, and said, What doest thouhere, Elijah?  
19:14 And he said, I have been very jealous for theLORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken thycovenant, thrown down thine altars, and slain thy prophets with thesword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take itaway.
19:15 And the LORD said unto him, Go, return on thy way to thewilderness of Damascus: and when thou comest, anoint Hazael to be kingover Syria: 
19:16 And Jehu the son of Nimshi shalt thou anoint to beking over Israel: and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abelmeholah shaltthou anoint to be prophet in thy room.
19:17 And it shall come to pass, that him that escapeth the sword ofHazael shall Jehu slay: and him that escapeth from the sword of Jehushall Elisha slay.
19:18 Yet I have left me seven thousand in Israel, all the knees whichhave not bowed unto Baal, and every mouth which hath not kissed him.
19:19 So he departed thence, and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, whowas plowing with twelve yoke of oxen before him, and he with thetwelfth: and Elijah passed by him, and cast his mantle upon him.
19:20 And he left the oxen, and ran after Elijah, and said, Let me, Ipray thee, kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow thee.And he said unto him, Go back again: for what have I done to thee?
19:21 And he returned back from him, and took a yoke of oxen, and slewthem, and boiled their flesh with the instruments of the oxen, andgave unto the people, and they did eat. Then he arose, and went afterElijah, and ministered unto him.
20:1 And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together:and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, andchariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.
20:2 And he sent messengers to Ahab king of Israel into the city, andsaid unto him, Thus saith Benhadad, 
20:3 Thy silver and thy gold ismine; thy wives also and thy children, even the goodliest, are mine.
20:4 And the king of Israel answered and said, My lord, O king,according to thy saying, I am thine, and all that I have.
20:5 And the messengers came again, and said, Thus speaketh Benhadad,saying, Although I have sent unto thee, saying, Thou shalt deliver methy silver, and thy gold, and thy wives, and thy children; 
20:6 Yet Iwill send my servants unto thee to morrow about this time, and theyshall search thine house, and the houses of thy servants; and it shallbe, that whatsoever is pleasant in thine eyes, they shall put it intheir hand, and take it away.
20:7 Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land, andsaid, Mark, I pray you, and see how this man seeketh mischief: for hesent unto me for my wives, and for my children, and for my silver, andfor my gold; and I denied him not.
20:8 And all the elders and all the people said unto him, Hearken notunto him, nor consent.
20:9 Wherefore he said unto the messengers of Benhadad, Tell my lordthe king, All that thou didst send for to thy servant at the first Iwill do: but this thing I may not do. And the messengers departed, andbrought him word again.
20:10 And Benhadad sent unto him, and said, The gods do so unto me,and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls forall the people that follow me.
20:11 And the king of Israel answered and said, Tell him, Let not himthat girdeth on his harness boast himself as he that putteth it off.
20:12 And it came to pass, when Ben-hadad heard this message, as hewas drinking, he and the kings in the pavilions, that he said unto hisservants, Set yourselves in array. And they set themselves in arrayagainst the city.
20:13 And, behold, there came a prophet unto Ahab king of Israel,saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hast thou seen all this great multitude?behold, I will deliver it into thine hand this day; and thou shaltknow that I am the LORD.
20:14 And Ahab said, By whom? And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Evenby the young men of the princes of the provinces. Then he said, Whoshall order the battle? And he answered, Thou.
20:15 Then he numbered the young men of the princes of the provinces,and they were two hundred and thirty two: and after them he numberedall the people, even all the children of Israel, being seven thousand.
20:16 And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himselfdrunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kingsthat helped him.
20:17 And the young men of the princes of the provinces went outfirst; and Benhadad sent out, and they told him, saying, There are mencome out of Samaria.
20:18 And he said, Whether they be come out for peace, take themalive; or whether they be come out for war, take them alive.
20:19 So these young men of the princes of the provinces came out ofthe city, and the army which followed them.
20:20 And they slew every one his man: and the Syrians fled; andIsrael pursued them: and Benhadad the king of Syria escaped on anhorse with the horsemen.
20:21 And the king of Israel went out, and smote the horses andchariots, and slew the Syrians with a great slaughter.
20:22 And the prophet came to the king of Israel, and said unto him,Go, strengthen thyself, and mark, and see what thou doest: for at thereturn of the year the king of Syria will come up against thee.
20:23 And the servants of the king of Syria said unto him, Their godsare gods of the hills; therefore they were stronger than we; but letus fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be strongerthan they.
20:24 And do this thing, Take the kings away, every man out of hisplace, and put captains in their rooms: 
20:25 And number thee an army,like the army that thou hast lost, horse for horse, and chariot forchariot: and we will fight against them in the plain, and surely weshall be stronger than they. And he hearkened unto their voice, anddid so.
20:26 And it came to pass at the return of the year, that Benhadadnumbered the Syrians, and went up to Aphek, to fight against Israel.
20:27 And the children of Israel were numbered, and were all present,and went against them: and the children of Israel pitched before themlike two little flocks of kids; but the Syrians filled the country.
20:28 And there came a man of God, and spake unto the king of Israel,and said, Thus saith the LORD, Because the Syrians have said, The LORDis God of the hills, but he is not God of the valleys, therefore willI deliver all this great multitude into thine hand, and ye shall knowthat I am the LORD.
20:29 And they pitched one over against the other seven days. And soit was, that in the seventh day the battle was joined: and thechildren of Israel slew of the Syrians an hundred thousand footmen inone day.
20:30 But the rest fled to Aphek, into the city; and there a wall fellupon twenty and seven thousand of the men that were left. And Benhadadfled, and came into the city, into an inner chamber.
20:31 And his servants said unto him, Behold now, we have heard thatthe kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings: let us, I praythee, put sackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go outto the king of Israel: peradventure he will save thy life.
20:32 So they girded sackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on theirheads, and came to the king of Israel, and said, Thy servant Benhadadsaith, I pray thee, let me live. And he said, Is he yet alive? he ismy brother.
20:33 Now the men did diligently observe whether any thing would comefrom him, and did hastily catch it: and they said, Thy brotherBenhadad. Then he said, Go ye, bring him. Then Benhadad came forth tohim; and he caused him to come up into the chariot.
20:34 And Ben-hadad said unto him, The cities, which my father tookfrom thy father, I will restore; and thou shalt make streets for theein Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will sendthee away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and senthim away.
20:35 And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said unto hisneighbour in the word of the LORD, Smite me, I pray thee. And the manrefused to smite him.
20:36 Then said he unto him, Because thou hast not obeyed the voice ofthe LORD, behold, as soon as thou art departed from me, a lion shallslay thee.And as soon as he was departed from him, a lion found him, and slewhim.
20:37 Then he found another man, and said, Smite me, I pray thee. Andthe man smote him, so that in smiting he wounded him.
20:38 So the prophet departed, and waited for the king by the way, anddisguised himself with ashes upon his face.
20:39 And as the king passed by, he cried unto the king: and he said,Thy servant went out into the midst of the battle; and, behold, a manturned aside, and brought a man unto me, and said, Keep this man: ifby any means he be missing, then shall thy life be for his life, orelse thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
20:40 And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And theking of Israel said unto him, So shall thy judgment be; thyself hastdecided it.
20:41 And he hasted, and took the ashes away from his face; and theking of Israel discerned him that he was of the prophets.
20:42 And he said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Because thou hast letgo out of thy hand a man whom I appointed to utter destruction,therefore thy life shall go for his life, and thy people for hispeople.
20:43 And the king of Israel went to his house heavy and displeased,and came to Samaria.
21:1 And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth theJezreelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezreel, hard by the palace ofAhab king of Samaria.
21:2 And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard, that Imay have it for a garden of herbs, because it is near unto my house:and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it; or, if it seemgood to thee, I will give thee the worth of it in money.
21:3 And Naboth said to Ahab, The LORD forbid it me, that I shouldgive the inheritance of my fathers unto thee.
21:4 And Ahab came into his house heavy and displeased because of theword which Naboth the Jezreelite had spoken to him: for he had said, Iwill not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And he laid him downupon his bed, and turned away his face, and would eat no bread.
21:5 But Jezebel his wife came to him, and said unto him, Why is thyspirit so sad, that thou eatest no bread?  
21:6 And he said unto her,Because I spake unto Naboth the Jezreelite, and said unto him, Give methy vineyard for money; or else, if it please thee, I will give theeanother vineyard for it: and he answered, I will not give thee myvineyard.
21:7 And Jezebel his wife said unto him, Dost thou now govern thekingdom of Israel? arise, and eat bread, and let thine heart be merry:I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite.
21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, and sealed them with hisseal, and sent the letters unto the elders and to the nobles that werein his city, dwelling with Naboth.
21:9 And she wrote in the letters, saying, Proclaim a fast, and setNaboth on high among the people: 
21:10 And set two men, sons ofBelial, before him, to bear witness against him, saying, Thou didstblaspheme God and the king. And then carry him out, and stone him,that he may die.
21:11 And the men of his city, even the elders and the nobles who werethe inhabitants in his city, did as Jezebel had sent unto them, and asit was written in the letters which she had sent unto them.
21:12 They proclaimed a fast, and set Naboth on high among the people.
21:13 And there came in two men, children of Belial, and sat beforehim: and the men of Belial witnessed against him, even against Naboth,in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth did blaspheme God andthe king. Then they carried him forth out of the city, and stoned himwith stones, that he died.
21:14 Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth is stoned, and isdead.
21:15 And it came to pass, when Jezebel heard that Naboth was stoned,and was dead, that Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of thevineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give thee formoney: for Naboth is not alive, but dead.
21:16 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, thatAhab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, totake possession of it.
21:17 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
21:18 Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, which is in Samaria:behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, whither he is gone down topossess it.
21:19 And thou shalt speak unto him, saying, Thus saith the LORD, Hastthou killed, and also taken possession? And thou shalt speak unto him,saying, Thus saith the LORD, In the place where dogs licked the bloodof Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, even thine.
21:20 And Ahab said to Elijah, Hast thou found me, O mine enemy? Andhe answered, I have found thee: because thou hast sold thyself to workevil in the sight of the LORD.
21:21 Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will take away thyposterity, and will cut off from Ahab him that pisseth against thewall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel, 
21:22 And will makethine house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like thehouse of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the provocation wherewith thouhast provoked me to anger, and made Israel to sin.
21:23 And of Jezebel also spake the LORD, saying, The dogs shall eatJezebel by the wall of Jezreel.
21:24 Him that dieth of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat; and himthat dieth in the field shall the fowls of the air eat.
21:25 But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself towork wickedness in the sight of the LORD, whom Jezebel his wifestirred up.
21:26 And he did very abominably in following idols, according to allthings as did the Amorites, whom the LORD cast out before the childrenof Israel.
21:27 And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he renthis clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay insackcloth, and went softly.
21:28 And the word of the LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,
21:29 Seest thou how Ahab humbleth himself before me? because hehumbleth himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days: butin his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.
22:1 And they continued three years without war between Syria andIsrael.
22:2 And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the kingof Judah came down to the king of Israel.
22:3 And the king of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye thatRamoth in Gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of thehand of the king of Syria?  
22:4 And he said unto Jehoshaphat, Wiltthou go with me to battle to Ramothgilead? And Jehoshaphat said to theking of Israel, I am as thou art, my people as thy people, my horsesas thy horses.
22:5 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I praythee, at the word of the LORD to day.
22:6 Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, aboutfour hundred men, and said unto them, Shall I go against Ramothgileadto battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORDshall deliver it into the hand of the king.
22:7 And Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORDbesides, that we might enquire of him?  
22:8 And the king of Israelsaid unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man, Micaiah the son of Imlah,by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for he doth notprophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let notthe king say so.
22:9 Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Hastenhither Micaiah the son of Imlah.
22:10 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah sateach on his throne, having put on their robes, in a void place in theentrance of the gate of Samaria; and all the prophets prophesiedbefore them.
22:11 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and hesaid, Thus saith the LORD, With these shalt thou push the Syrians,until thou have consumed them.
22:12 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up toRamothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into theking's hand.
22:13 And the messenger that was gone to call Micaiah spake unto him,saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets declare good unto theking with one mouth: let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word ofone of them, and speak that which is good.
22:14 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, what the LORD saith untome, that will I speak.
22:15 So he came to the king. And the king said unto him, Micaiah,shall we go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall we forbear? Andhe answered him, Go, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it intothe hand of the king.
22:16 And the king said unto him, How many times shall I adjure theethat thou tell me nothing but that which is true in the name of theLORD?  
22:17 And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills,as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have nomaster: let them return every man to his house in peace.
22:18 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, Did I not tellthee that he would prophesy no good concerning me, but evil?  
22:19 And he said, Hear thou therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORDsitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him onhis right hand and on his left.
22:20 And the LORD said, Who shall persuade Ahab, that he may go upand fall at Ramothgilead? And one said on this manner, and anothersaid on that manner.
22:21 And there came forth a spirit, and stood before the LORD, andsaid, I will persuade him.
22:22 And the LORD said unto him, Wherewith? And he said, I will goforth, and I will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.And he said, Thou shalt persude him, and prevail also: go forth, anddo so.
22:23 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in themouth of all these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evilconcerning thee.
22:24 But Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah went near, and smote Micaiahon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of the LORD from meto speak unto thee?  
22:25 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see inthat day, when thou shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.
22:26 And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him backunto Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son; 
22:27 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feedhim with bread of affliction and with water of affliction, until Icome in peace.
22:28 And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, the LORD hathnot spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, O people, every one of you.
22:29 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went upto Ramothgilead.
22:30 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguisemyself, and enter into the battle; but put thou on thy robes. And theking of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.
22:31 But the king of Syria commanded his thirty and two captains thathad rule over his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small norgreat, save only with the king of Israel.
22:32 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots sawJehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel. And theyturned aside to fight against him: and Jehoshaphat cried out.
22:33 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots perceivedthat it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back frompursuing him.
22:34 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king ofIsrael between the joints of the harness: wherefore he said unto thedriver of his chariot, Turn thine hand, and carry me out of the host;for I am wounded.
22:35 And the battle increased that day: and the king was stayed up inhis chariot against the Syrians, and died at even: and the blood ranout of the wound into the midst of the chariot.
22:36 And there went a proclamation throughout the host about thegoing down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man tohis own country.
22:37 So the king died, and was brought to Samaria; and they buriedthe king in Samaria.
22:38 And one washed the chariot in the pool of Samaria; and the dogslicked up his blood; and they washed his armour; according unto theword of the LORD which he spake.
22:39 Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and theivory house which he made, and all the cities that he built, are theynot written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?
22:40 So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahaziah his son reigned inhis stead.
22:41 And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in thefourth year of Ahab king of Israel.
22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty and five years old when he began toreign; and he reigned twenty and five years in Jerusalem. And hismother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.
22:43 And he walked in all the ways of Asa his father; he turned notaside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of the LORD:nevertheless the high places were not taken away; for the peopleoffered and burnt incense yet in the high places.
22:44 And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.
22:45 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that heshewed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of thechronicles of the kings of Judah?  
22:46 And the remnant of thesodomites, which remained in the days of his father Asa, he took outof the land.
22:47 There was then no king in Edom: a deputy was king.
22:48 Jehoshaphat made ships of Tharshish to go to Ophir for gold: butthey went not; for the ships were broken at Eziongeber.
22:49 Then said Ahaziah the son of Ahab unto Jehoshaphat, Let myservants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.
22:50 And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with hisfathers in the city of David his father: and Jehoram his son reignedin his stead.
22:51 Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samariathe seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twoyears over Israel.
22:52 And he did evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the wayof his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way ofJeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin: 
22:53 For he servedBaal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger the LORD God ofIsrael, according to all that his father had done.
