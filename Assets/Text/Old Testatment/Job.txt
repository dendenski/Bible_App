1:1 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and thatman was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and eschewed evil.
1:2 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.
1:3 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousandcamels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she asses, anda very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all themen of the east.
1:4 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his day;and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink withthem.
1:5 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about,that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning,and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all: forJob said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in theirhearts. Thus did Job continually.
1:6 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to presentthemselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.
1:7 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satananswered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, andfrom walking up and down in it.
1:8 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an uprightman, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?  
1:9 Then Satananswered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?  
1:10 Hastnot thou made an hedge about him, and about his house, and about allthat he hath on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands,and his substance is increased in the land.
1:11 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and hewill curse thee to thy face.
1:12 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thypower; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So Satan went forthfrom the presence of the LORD.
1:13 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eatingand drinking wine in their eldest brother's house: 
1:14 And there camea messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the assesfeeding beside them: 
1:15 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and tookthem away; yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of thesword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
1:16 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thefire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep, andthe servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tellthee.
1:17 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, TheChaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels, and havecarried them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of thesword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.
1:18 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thysons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldestbrother's house: 
1:19 And, behold, there came a great wind from thewilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell uponthe young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tellthee.
1:20 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, andfell down upon the ground, and worshipped, 
1:21 And said, Naked came Iout of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORDgave, and the LORD hath taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.
1:22 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.
2:1 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to presentthemselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to presenthimself before the LORD.
2:2 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satananswered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, andfrom walking up and down in it.
2:3 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job,that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an uprightman, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and still he holdethfast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroyhim without cause.
2:4 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, allthat a man hath will he give for his life.
2:5 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh,and he will curse thee to thy face.
2:6 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; butsave his life.
2:7 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote Jobwith sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.
2:8 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he satdown among the ashes.
2:9 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thineintegrity?  curse God, and die.
2:10 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish womenspeaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall wenot receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.
2:11 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was comeupon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz theTemanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for theyhad made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and tocomfort him.
2:12 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one hismantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.
2:13 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and sevennights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his griefwas very great.
3:1 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.
3:2 And Job spake, and said, 
3:3 Let the day perish wherein I wasborn, and the night in which it was said, There is a man childconceived.
3:4 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,neither let the light shine upon it.
3:5 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwellupon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.
3:6 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not bejoined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the number ofthe months.
3:7 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come therein.
3:8 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise uptheir mourning.
3:9 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look forlight, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day: 
3:10 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrowfrom mine eyes.
3:11 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghostwhen I came out of the belly?  
3:12 Why did the knees prevent me? orwhy the breasts that I should suck?  
3:13 For now should I have lainstill and been quiet, I should have slept: then had I been at rest,
3:14 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolateplaces for themselves; 
3:15 Or with princes that had gold, who filledtheir houses with silver: 
3:16 Or as an hidden untimely birth I hadnot been; as infants which never saw light.
3:17 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be atrest.
3:18 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of theoppressor.
3:19 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from hismaster.
3:20 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life untothe bitter in soul; 
3:21 Which long for death, but it cometh not; anddig for it more than for hid treasures; 
3:22 Which rejoiceexceedingly, and are glad, when they can find the grave?  
3:23 Why islight given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God hath hedged in?
3:24 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are pouredout like the waters.
3:25 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and thatwhich I was afraid of is come unto me.
3:26 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet; yettrouble came.
4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said, 
4:2 If we assay tocommune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but who can withhold himselffrom speaking?  
4:3 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou haststrengthened the weak hands.
4:4 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou haststrengthened the feeble knees.
4:5 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth thee,and thou art troubled.
4:6 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and theuprightness of thy ways?  
4:7 Remember, I pray thee, who everperished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off?  
4:8 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reapthe same.
4:9 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his nostrilsare they consumed.
4:10 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, andthe teeth of the young lions, are broken.
4:11 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion'swhelps are scattered abroad.
4:12 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received alittle thereof.
4:13 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleepfalleth on men, 
4:14 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made allmy bones to shake.
4:15 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh stoodup: 
4:16 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: animage was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a voice,saying, 
4:17 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man bemore pure than his maker?  
4:18 Behold, he put no trust in hisservants; and his angels he charged with folly: 
4:19 How much less inthem that dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust,which are crushed before the moth?  
4:20 They are destroyed frommorning to evening: they perish for ever without any regarding it.
4:21 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,even without wisdom.
5:1 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which ofthe saints wilt thou turn?  
5:2 For wrath killeth the foolish man, andenvy slayeth the silly one.
5:3 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed hishabitation.
5:4 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in thegate, neither is there any to deliver them.
5:5 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of thethorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.
5:6 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither dothtrouble spring out of the ground; 
5:7 Yet man is born unto trouble, asthe sparks fly upward.
5:8 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause: 
5:9 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things withoutnumber: 
5:10 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters uponthe fields: 
5:11 To set up on high those that be low; that those whichmourn may be exalted to safety.
5:12 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their handscannot perform their enterprise.
5:13 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel ofthe froward is carried headlong.
5:14 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the noondayas in the night.
5:15 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and fromthe hand of the mighty.
5:16 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.
5:17 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despisenot thou the chastening of the Almighty: 
5:18 For he maketh sore, andbindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands make whole.
5:19 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there shallno evil touch thee.
5:20 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from thepower of the sword.
5:21 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither shaltthou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.
5:22 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou beafraid of the beasts of the earth.
5:23 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and thebeasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.
5:24 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; andthou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.
5:25 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thineoffspring as the grass of the earth.
5:26 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock ofcorn cometh in in his season.
5:27 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou itfor thy good.
6:1 But Job answered and said, 
6:2 Oh that my grief were throughlyweighed, and my calamity laid in the balances together!  
6:3 For nowit would be heavier than the sand of the sea: therefore my words areswallowed up.
6:4 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison whereofdrinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set themselves in arrayagainst me.
6:5 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox overhis fodder?  
6:6 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? oris there any taste in the white of an egg?  
6:7 The things that mysoul refused to touch are as my sorrowful meat.
6:8 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me thething that I long for!  
6:9 Even that it would please God to destroyme; that he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!  
6:10 Thenshould I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in sorrow: lethim not spare; for I have not concealed the words of the Holy One.
6:11 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,that I should prolong my life?  
6:12 Is my strength the strength ofstones? or is my flesh of brass?  
6:13 Is not my help in me? and iswisdom driven quite from me?  
6:14 To him that is afflicted pityshould be shewed from his friend; but he forsaketh the fear of theAlmighty.
6:15 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the streamof brooks they pass away; 
6:16 Which are blackish by reason of theice, and wherein the snow is hid: 
6:17 What time they wax warm, theyvanish: when it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.
6:18 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing, andperish.
6:19 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited forthem.
6:20 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither,and were ashamed.
6:21 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are afraid.
6:22 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of yoursubstance?  
6:23 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem mefrom the hand of the mighty?  
6:24 Teach me, and I will hold mytongue: and cause me to understand wherein I have erred.
6:25 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing reprove?
6:26 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that isdesperate, which are as wind?  
6:27 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless,and ye dig a pit for your friend.
6:28 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident untoyou if I lie.
6:29 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again, myrighteousness is in it.
6:30 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern perversethings?  
7:1 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are nothis days also like the days of an hireling?  
7:2 As a servantearnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling looketh for thereward of his work: 
7:3 So am I made to possess months of vanity, andwearisome nights are appointed to me.
7:4 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be gone?and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.
7:5 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin isbroken, and become loathsome.
7:6 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent withouthope.
7:7 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see good.
7:8 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine eyesare upon me, and I am not.
7:9 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth downto the grave shall come up no more.
7:10 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his placeknow him any more.
7:11 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in theanguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul.
7:12 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?  
7:13 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease mycomplaints; 
7:14 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest methrough visions: 
7:15 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and deathrather than my life.
7:16 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my daysare vanity.
7:17 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thoushouldest set thine heart upon him?  
7:18 And that thou shouldestvisit him every morning, and try him every moment?  
7:19 How long wiltthou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I swallow down myspittle?  
7:20 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thoupreserver of men?  why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, sothat I am a burden to myself?  
7:21 And why dost thou not pardon mytransgression, and take away my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in thedust; and thou shalt seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.
8:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
8:2 How long wilt thouspeak these things? and how long shall the words of thy mouth be likea strong wind?  
8:3 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almightypervert justice?  
8:4 If thy children have sinned against him, and hehave cast them away for their transgression; 
8:5 If thou wouldest seekunto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
8:6 Ifthou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for thee, andmake the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.
8:7 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should greatlyincrease.
8:8 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyselfto the search of their fathers: 
8:9 (For we are but of yesterday, andknow nothing, because our days upon earth are a shadow:) 
8:10 Shallnot they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out of theirheart?  
8:11 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag growwithout water?  
8:12 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cutdown, it withereth before any other herb.
8:13 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's hopeshall perish: 
8:14 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shallbe a spider's web.
8:15 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shallhold it fast, but it shall not endure.
8:16 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in hisgarden.
8:17 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place ofstones.
8:18 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him, saying,I have not seen thee.
8:19 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shallothers grow.
8:20 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will hehelp the evil doers: 
8:21 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, andthy lips with rejoicing.
8:22 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the dwellingplace of the wicked shall come to nought.
9:1 Then Job answered and said, 
9:2 I know it is so of a truth: buthow should man be just with God?  
9:3 If he will contend with him, hecannot answer him one of a thousand.
9:4 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardenedhimself against him, and hath prospered?  
9:5 Which removeth themountains, and they know not: which overturneth them in his anger.
9:6 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars thereoftremble.
9:7 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up thestars.
9:8 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the wavesof the sea.
9:9 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers ofthe south.
9:10 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonderswithout number.
9:11 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but Iperceive him not.
9:12 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say untohim, What doest thou?  
9:13 If God will not withdraw his anger, theproud helpers do stoop under him.
9:14 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words toreason with him?  
9:15 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I notanswer, but I would make supplication to my judge.
9:16 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not believethat he had hearkened unto my voice.
9:17 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my woundswithout cause.
9:18 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me withbitterness.
9:19 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment, whoshall set me a time to plead?  
9:20 If I justify myself, mine ownmouth shall condemn me: if I say, I am perfect, it shall also prove meperverse.
9:21 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I woulddespise my life.
9:22 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the perfectand the wicked.
9:23 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of theinnocent.
9:24 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth thefaces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?  
9:25 Nowmy days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see no good.
9:26 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle thathasteth to the prey.
9:27 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off myheaviness, and comfort myself: 
9:28 I am afraid of all my sorrows, Iknow that thou wilt not hold me innocent.
9:29 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?  
9:30 If I wash myselfwith snow water, and make my hands never so clean; 
9:31 Yet shalt thouplunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes shall abhor me.
9:32 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and weshould come together in judgment.
9:33 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his handupon us both.
9:34 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear terrifyme: 
9:35 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so withme.
10:1 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint uponmyself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.
10:2 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thoucontendest with me.
10:3 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thoushouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counselof the wicked?  
10:4 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as manseeth?  
10:5 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man'sdays, 
10:6 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchestafter my sin?  
10:7 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there isnone that can deliver out of thine hand.
10:8 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round about;yet thou dost destroy me.
10:9 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay; andwilt thou bring me into dust again?  
10:10 Hast thou not poured me outas milk, and curdled me like cheese?  
10:11 Thou hast clothed me withskin and flesh, and hast fenced me with bones and sinews.
10:12 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hathpreserved my spirit.
10:13 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that thisis with thee.
10:14 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me frommine iniquity.
10:15 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will Inot lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see thou mineaffliction; 
10:16 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion:and again thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.
10:17 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thineindignation upon me; changes and war are against me.
10:18 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Ohthat I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!  
10:19 I shouldhave been as though I had not been; I should have been carried fromthe womb to the grave.
10:20 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I maytake comfort a little, 
10:21 Before I go whence I shall not return,even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death; 
10:22 A land ofdarkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of death, without anyorder, and where the light is as darkness.
11:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
11:2 Should notthe multitude of words be answered? and should a man full of talk bejustified?  
11:3 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and whenthou mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?  
11:4 For thou hastsaid, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in thine eyes.
11:5 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee; 
11:6 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they aredouble to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth of thee lessthan thine iniquity deserveth.
11:7 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out theAlmighty unto perfection?  
11:8 It is as high as heaven; what canstthou do? deeper than hell; what canst thou know?  
11:9 The measurethereof is longer than the earth, and broader than the sea.
11:10 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who canhinder him?  
11:11 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also;will he not then consider it?  
11:12 For vain men would be wise,though man be born like a wild ass's colt.
11:13 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands towardhim; 
11:14 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let notwickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.
11:15 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thoushalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear: 
11:16 Because thou shalt forgetthy misery, and remember it as waters that pass away: 
11:17 And thineage shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt shine forth, thoushalt be as the morning.
11:18 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou shaltdig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.
11:19 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid; yea,many shall make suit unto thee.
11:20 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall notescape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.
12:1 And Job answered and said, 
12:2 No doubt but ye are the people,and wisdom shall die with you.
12:3 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior toyou: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?  
12:4 I am as onemocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and he answereth him:the just upright man is laughed to scorn.
12:5 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised inthe thought of him that is at ease.
12:6 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God aresecure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.
12:7 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the fowlsof the air, and they shall tell thee: 
12:8 Or speak to the earth, andit shall teach thee: and the fishes of the sea shall declare untothee.
12:9 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hathwrought this?  
12:10 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing,and the breath of all mankind.
12:11 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?  
12:12 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days understanding.
12:13 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel andunderstanding.
12:14 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: heshutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.
12:15 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also hesendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.
12:16 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiverare his.
12:17 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judgesfools.
12:18 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with agirdle.
12:19 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.
12:20 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away theunderstanding of the aged.
12:21 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength ofthe mighty.
12:22 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out tolight the shadow of death.
12:23 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth thenations, and straiteneth them again.
12:24 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of theearth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there is noway.
12:25 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them tostagger like a drunken man.
13:1 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard andunderstood it.
13:2 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior untoyou.
13:3 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason withGod.
13:4 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.
13:5 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be yourwisdom.
13:6 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my lips.
13:7 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?
13:8 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?  
13:9 Is itgood that he should search you out? or as one man mocketh another, doye so mock him?  
13:10 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretlyaccept persons.
13:11 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fallupon you?  
13:12 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies tobodies of clay.
13:13 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come onme what will.
13:14 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life inmine hand?  
13:15 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but Iwill maintain mine own ways before him.
13:16 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not comebefore him.
13:17 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.
13:18 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall bejustified.
13:19 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my tongue,I shall give up the ghost.
13:20 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself fromthee.
13:21 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make meafraid.
13:22 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answerthou me.
13:23 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know mytransgression and my sin.
13:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine enemy?
13:25 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursuethe dry stubble?  
13:26 For thou writest bitter things against me, andmakest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.
13:27 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowlyunto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my feet.
13:28 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is motheaten.
14:1 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of trouble.
14:2 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also asa shadow, and continueth not.
14:3 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest meinto judgment with thee?  
14:4 Who can bring a clean thing out of anunclean? not one.
14:5 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are withthee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass; 
14:6 Turnfrom him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as an hireling,his day.
14:7 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it willsprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not cease.
14:8 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stockthereof die in the ground; 
14:9 Yet through the scent of water it willbud, and bring forth boughs like a plant.
14:10 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,and where is he?  
14:11 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flooddecayeth and drieth up: 
14:12 So man lieth down, and riseth not: tillthe heavens be no more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out oftheir sleep.
14:13 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldestkeep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest appoint mea set time, and remember me!  
14:14 If a man die, shall he live again?all the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.
14:15 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a desireto the work of thine hands.
14:16 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over mysin?  
14:17 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest upmine iniquity.
14:18 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the rockis removed out of his place.
14:19 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things whichgrow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the hope ofman.
14:20 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thouchangest his countenance, and sendest him away.
14:21 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they arebrought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.
14:22 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within himshall mourn.
15:1 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said, 
15:2 Should a wiseman utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind?  
15:3 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches wherewith hecan do no good?  
15:4 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainestprayer before God.
15:5 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest thetongue of the crafty.
15:6 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own lipstestify against thee.
15:7 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made beforethe hills?  
15:8 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thourestrain wisdom to thyself?  
15:9 What knowest thou, that we know not?what understandest thou, which is not in us?  
15:10 With us are boththe grayheaded and very aged men, much elder than thy father.
15:11 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any secretthing with thee?  
15:12 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and whatdo thy eyes wink at, 
15:13 That thou turnest thy spirit against God,and lettest such words go out of thy mouth?  
15:14 What is man, thathe should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should berighteous?  
15:15 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, theheavens are not clean in his sight.
15:16 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinkethiniquity like water?  
15:17 I will shew thee, hear me; and that whichI have seen I will declare; 
15:18 Which wise men have told from theirfathers, and have not hid it: 
15:19 Unto whom alone the earth wasgiven, and no stranger passed among them.
15:20 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the numberof years is hidden to the oppressor.
15:21 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyershall come upon him.
15:22 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he iswaited for of the sword.
15:23 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweththat the day of darkness is ready at his hand.
15:24 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevailagainst him, as a king ready to the battle.
15:25 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengthenethhimself against the Almighty.
15:26 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses ofhis bucklers: 
15:27 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, andmaketh collops of fat on his flanks.
15:28 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no maninhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.
15:29 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the earth.
15:30 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up hisbranches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.
15:31 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shallbe his recompence.
15:32 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shallnot be green.
15:33 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall castoff his flower as the olive.
15:34 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fireshall consume the tabernacles of bribery.
15:35 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their bellyprepareth deceit.
16:1 Then Job answered and said, 
16:2 I have heard many such things:miserable comforters are ye all.
16:3 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that thouanswerest?  
16:4 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in mysoul's stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine headat you.
16:5 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of mylips should asswage your grief.
16:6 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I forbear,what am I eased?  
16:7 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast madedesolate all my company.
16:8 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness againstme: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to my face.
16:9 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon mewith his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.
16:10 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten meupon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves togetheragainst me.
16:11 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over intothe hands of the wicked.
16:12 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also takenme by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up for his mark.
16:13 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reinsasunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the ground.
16:14 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me likea giant.
16:15 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in thedust.
16:16 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow ofdeath; 
16:17 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer ispure.
16:18 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no place.
16:19 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is onhigh.
16:20 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.
16:21 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth forhis neighbour!  
16:22 When a few years are come, then I shall go theway whence I shall not return.
17:1 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are readyfor me.
17:2 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue intheir provocation?  
17:3 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee;who is he that will strike hands with me?  
17:4 For thou hast hidtheir heart from understanding: therefore shalt thou not exalt them.
17:5 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of hischildren shall fail.
17:6 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I wasas a tabret.
17:7 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members areas a shadow.
17:8 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shallstir up himself against the hypocrite.
17:9 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath cleanhands shall be stronger and stronger.
17:10 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannotfind one wise man among you.
17:11 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the thoughtsof my heart.
17:12 They change the night into day: the light is short because ofdarkness.
17:13 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in thedarkness.
17:14 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm, Thouart my mother, and my sister.
17:15 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?
17:16 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our resttogether is in the dust.
18:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said, 
18:2 How long will itbe ere ye make an end of words? mark, and afterwards we will speak.
18:3 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in yoursight?  
18:4 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth beforsaken for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?
18:5 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark ofhis fire shall not shine.
18:6 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle shallbe put out with him.
18:7 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his owncounsel shall cast him down.
18:8 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon asnare.
18:9 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall prevailagainst him.
18:10 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him inthe way.
18:11 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive himto his feet.
18:12 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall beready at his side.
18:13 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn ofdeath shall devour his strength.
18:14 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and itshall bring him to the king of terrors.
18:15 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.
18:16 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his branchbe cut off.
18:17 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall haveno name in the street.
18:18 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out ofthe world.
18:19 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor anyremaining in his dwellings.
18:20 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as theythat went before were affrighted.
18:21 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is theplace of him that knoweth not God.
19:1 Then Job answered and said, 
19:2 How long will ye vex my soul,and break me in pieces with words?  
19:3 These ten times have yereproached me: ye are not ashamed that ye make yourselves strange tome.
19:4 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth withmyself.
19:5 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and pleadagainst me my reproach: 
19:6 Know now that God hath overthrown me, andhath compassed me with his net.
19:7 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, butthere is no judgment.
19:8 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath setdarkness in my paths.
19:9 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from myhead.
19:10 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine hopehath he removed like a tree.
19:11 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth meunto him as one of his enemies.
19:12 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me, andencamp round about my tabernacle.
19:13 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance areverily estranged from me.
19:14 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have forgottenme.
19:15 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for astranger: I am an alien in their sight.
19:16 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated himwith my mouth.
19:17 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for thechildren's sake of mine own body.
19:18 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake againstme.
19:19 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved areturned against me.
19:20 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escapedwith the skin of my teeth.
19:21 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for thehand of God hath touched me.
19:22 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with myflesh?  
19:23 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they wereprinted in a book!  
19:24 That they were graven with an iron pen andlead in the rock for ever!  
19:25 For I know that my redeemer liveth,and that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth: 
19:26 Andthough after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall Isee God: 
19:27 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shallbehold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me.
19:28 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of thematter is found in me?  
19:29 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrathbringeth the punishments of the sword, that ye may know there is ajudgment.
20:1 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said, 
20:2 Therefore domy thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I make haste.
20:3 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of myunderstanding causeth me to answer.
20:4 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,
20:5 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of thehypocrite but for a moment?  
20:6 Though his excellency mount up tothe heavens, and his head reach unto the clouds; 
20:7 Yet he shallperish for ever like his own dung: they which have seen him shall say,Where is he?  
20:8 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not befound: yea, he shall be chased away as a vision of the night.
20:9 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither shallhis place any more behold him.
20:10 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands shallrestore their goods.
20:11 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie downwith him in the dust.
20:12 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it underhis tongue; 
20:13 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep itstill within his mouth: 
20:14 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, itis the gall of asps within him.
20:15 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up again:God shall cast them out of his belly.
20:16 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall slayhim.
20:17 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey andbutter.
20:18 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall notswallow it down: according to his substance shall the restitution be,and he shall not rejoice therein.
20:19 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because hehath violently taken away an house which he builded not; 
20:20 Surelyhe shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not save of thatwhich he desired.
20:21 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no manlook for his goods.
20:22 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits: everyhand of the wicked shall come upon him.
20:23 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury ofhis wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is eating.
20:24 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shallstrike him through.
20:25 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glitteringsword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.
20:26 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not blownshall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left in histabernacle.
20:27 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall riseup against him.
20:28 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall flowaway in the day of his wrath.
20:29 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritageappointed unto him by God.
21:1 But Job answered and said, 
21:2 Hear diligently my speech, andlet this be your consolations.
21:3 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mockon.
21:4 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why shouldnot my spirit be troubled?  
21:5 Mark me, and be astonished, and layyour hand upon your mouth.
21:6 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on myflesh.
21:7 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty inpower?  
21:8 Their seed is established in their sight with them, andtheir offspring before their eyes.
21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God uponthem.
21:10 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, andcasteth not her calf.
21:11 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and theirchildren dance.
21:12 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of theorgan.
21:13 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to thegrave.
21:14 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire notthe knowledge of thy ways.
21:15 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what profitshould we have, if we pray unto him?  
21:16 Lo, their good is not intheir hand: the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
21:17 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft comeththeir destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows in his anger.
21:18 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the stormcarrieth away.
21:19 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,and he shall know it.
21:20 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of thewrath of the Almighty.
21:21 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when thenumber of his months is cut off in the midst?  
21:22 Shall any teachGod knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that are high.
21:23 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet.
21:24 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened withmarrow.
21:25 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and nevereateth with pleasure.
21:26 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall coverthem.
21:27 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which yewrongfully imagine against me.
21:28 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are thedwelling places of the wicked?  
21:29 Have ye not asked them that goby the way? and do ye not know their tokens, 
21:30 That the wicked isreserved to the day of destruction? they shall be brought forth to theday of wrath.
21:31 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay himwhat he hath done?  
21:32 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, andshall remain in the tomb.
21:33 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every manshall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.
21:34 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers thereremaineth falsehood?  
22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered andsaid, 
22:2 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may beprofitable unto himself?  
22:3 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty,that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him, that thou makest thyways perfect?  
22:4 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will heenter with thee into judgment?  
22:5 Is not thy wickedness great? andthine iniquities infinite?  
22:6 For thou hast taken a pledge from thybrother for nought, and stripped the naked of their clothing.
22:7 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hastwithholden bread from the hungry.
22:8 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the honourableman dwelt in it.
22:9 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherlesshave been broken.
22:10 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear troubleththee; 
22:11 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance ofwaters cover thee.
22:12 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of thestars, how high they are!  
22:13 And thou sayest, How doth God know?can he judge through the dark cloud?  
22:14 Thick clouds are acovering to him, that he seeth not; and he walketh in the circuit ofheaven.
22:15 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?
22:16 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was overflownwith a flood: 
22:17 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what canthe Almighty do for them?  
22:18 Yet he filled their houses with goodthings: but the counsel of the wicked is far from me.
22:19 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh themto scorn.
22:20 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of themthe fire consumeth.
22:21 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby goodshall come unto thee.
22:22 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up hiswords in thine heart.
22:23 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thoushalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.
22:24 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir asthe stones of the brooks.
22:25 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt haveplenty of silver.
22:26 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and shaltlift up thy face unto God.
22:27 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee, andthou shalt pay thy vows.
22:28 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established untothee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.
22:29 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is liftingup; and he shall save the humble person.
22:30 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is deliveredby the pureness of thine hands.
23:1 Then Job answered and said, 
23:2 Even to day is my complaintbitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning.
23:3 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even tohis seat!  
23:4 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouthwith arguments.
23:5 I would know the words which he would answer me, and understandwhat he would say unto me.
23:6 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he wouldput strength in me.
23:7 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I bedelivered for ever from my judge.
23:8 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but Icannot perceive him: 
23:9 On the left hand, where he doth work, but Icannot behold him: he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannotsee him: 
23:10 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath triedme, I shall come forth as gold.
23:11 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and notdeclined.
23:12 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; Ihave esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food.
23:13 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his souldesireth, even that he doeth.
23:14 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and manysuch things are with him.
23:15 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I amafraid of him.
23:16 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:
23:17 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath hecovered the darkness from my face.
24:1 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they thatknow him not see his days?  
24:2 Some remove the landmarks; theyviolently take away flocks, and feed thereof.
24:3 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the widow'sox for a pledge.
24:4 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hidethemselves together.
24:5 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their work;rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food for them andfor their children.
24:6 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather thevintage of the wicked.
24:7 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have nocovering in the cold.
24:8 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace therock for want of a shelter.
24:9 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge ofthe poor.
24:10 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take awaythe sheaf from the hungry; 
24:11 Which make oil within their walls,and tread their winepresses, and suffer thirst.
24:12 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the woundedcrieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.
24:13 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know notthe ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.
24:14 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,and in the night is as a thief.
24:15 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight, saying,No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.
24:16 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked forthemselves in the daytime: they know not the light.
24:17 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if oneknow them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.
24:18 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the earth:he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.
24:19 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the gravethose which have sinned.
24:20 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken as atree.
24:21 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth notgood to the widow.
24:22 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and noman is sure of life.
24:23 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth; yethis eyes are upon their ways.
24:24 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and broughtlow; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off as thetops of the ears of corn.
24:25 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make myspeech nothing worth?  
25:1 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, andsaid, 
25:2 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his highplaces.
25:3 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not hislight arise?  
25:4 How then can man be justified with God? or how canhe be clean that is born of a woman?  
25:5 Behold even to the moon,and it shineth not; yea, the stars are not pure in his sight.
25:6 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which is aworm?  
26:1 But Job answered and said, 
26:2 How hast thou helped himthat is without power? how savest thou the arm that hath no strength?
26:3 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hastthou plentifully declared the thing as it is?  
26:4 To whom hast thouuttered words? and whose spirit came from thee?  
26:5 Dead things areformed from under the waters, and the inhabitants thereof.
26:6 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.
26:7 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth theearth upon nothing.
26:8 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud isnot rent under them.
26:9 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his cloudupon it.
26:10 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day andnight come to an end.
26:11 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his reproof.
26:12 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding hesmiteth through the proud.
26:13 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hathformed the crooked serpent.
26:14 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion isheard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?  
27:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
27:2 As God liveth, whohath taken away my judgment; and the Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;
27:3 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in mynostrils; 
27:4 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utterdeceit.
27:5 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will notremove mine integrity from me.
27:6 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heartshall not reproach me so long as I live.
27:7 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against meas the unrighteous.
27:8 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,when God taketh away his soul?  
27:9 Will God hear his cry whentrouble cometh upon him?  
27:10 Will he delight himself in theAlmighty? will he always call upon God?  
27:11 I will teach you by thehand of God: that which is with the Almighty will I not conceal.
27:12 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thusaltogether vain?  
27:13 This is the portion of a wicked man with God,and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of theAlmighty.
27:14 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and hisoffspring shall not be satisfied with bread.
27:15 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and hiswidows shall not weep.
27:16 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as theclay; 
27:17 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and theinnocent shall divide the silver.
27:18 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the keepermaketh.
27:19 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: heopeneth his eyes, and he is not.
27:20 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him awayin the night.
27:21 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as astorm hurleth him out of his place.
27:22 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain fleeout of his hand.
27:23 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of hisplace.
28:1 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold wherethey fine it.
28:2 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of thestone.
28:3 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all perfection:the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.
28:4 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the watersforgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away from men.
28:5 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is turnedup as it were fire.
28:6 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust ofgold.
28:7 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture'seye hath not seen: 
28:8 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor thefierce lion passed by it.
28:9 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth themountains by the roots.
28:10 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth everyprecious thing.
28:11 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that ishid bringeth he forth to light.
28:12 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place ofunderstanding?  
28:13 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is itfound in the land of the living.
28:14 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is notwith me.
28:15 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighedfor the price thereof.
28:16 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the preciousonyx, or the sapphire.
28:17 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of itshall not be for jewels of fine gold.
28:18 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the priceof wisdom is above rubies.
28:19 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it bevalued with pure gold.
28:20 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place ofunderstanding?  
28:21 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living,and kept close from the fowls of the air.
28:22 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof withour ears.
28:23 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the placethereof.
28:24 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under thewhole heaven; 
28:25 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheththe waters by measure.
28:26 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the lightningof the thunder: 
28:27 Then did he see it, and declare it; he preparedit, yea, and searched it out.
28:28 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that iswisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.
29:1 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said, 
29:2 Oh that I wereas in months past, as in the days when God preserved me; 
29:3 When hiscandle shined upon my head, and when by his light I walked throughdarkness; 
29:4 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret ofGod was upon my tabernacle; 
29:5 When the Almighty was yet with me,when my children were about me; 
29:6 When I washed my steps withbutter, and the rock poured me out rivers of oil; 
29:7 When I went outto the gate through the city, when I prepared my seat in the street!
29:8 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose, andstood up.
29:9 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on theirmouth.
29:10 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to theroof of their mouth.
29:11 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye sawme, it gave witness to me: 
29:12 Because I delivered the poor thatcried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to help him.
29:13 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and Icaused the widow's heart to sing for joy.
29:14 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as arobe and a diadem.
29:15 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.
29:16 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not Isearched out.
29:17 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out ofhis teeth.
29:18 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply mydays as the sand.
29:19 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all nightupon my branch.
29:20 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.
29:21 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at mycounsel.
29:22 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped uponthem.
29:23 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened theirmouth wide as for the latter rain.
29:24 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of mycountenance they cast not down.
29:25 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in thearmy, as one that comforteth the mourners.
30:1 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision, whosefathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs of my flock.
30:2 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in whomold age was perished?  
30:3 For want and famine they were solitary;fleeing into the wilderness in former time desolate and waste.
30:4 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for theirmeat.
30:5 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them asafter a thief;) 
30:6 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in cavesof the earth, and in the rocks.
30:7 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they weregathered together.
30:8 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they wereviler than the earth.
30:9 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.
30:10 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit inmy face.
30:11 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have alsolet loose the bridle before me.
30:12 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, andthey raise up against me the ways of their destruction.
30:13 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have nohelper.
30:14 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in thedesolation they rolled themselves upon me.
30:15 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind: andmy welfare passeth away as a cloud.
30:16 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of afflictionhave taken hold upon me.
30:17 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinewstake no rest.
30:18 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: itbindeth me about as the collar of my coat.
30:19 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust andashes.
30:20 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and thouregardest me not.
30:21 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou opposestthyself against me.
30:22 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon it,and dissolvest my substance.
30:23 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houseappointed for all living.
30:24 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, thoughthey cry in his destruction.
30:25 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soulgrieved for the poor?  
30:26 When I looked for good, then evil cameunto me: and when I waited for light, there came darkness.
30:27 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of afflictionprevented me.
30:28 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in thecongregation.
30:29 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.
30:30 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.
30:31 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the voiceof them that weep.
31:1 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon amaid?  
31:2 For what portion of God is there from above? and whatinheritance of the Almighty from on high?  
31:3 Is not destruction tothe wicked? and a strange punishment to the workers of iniquity?  
31:4 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?  
31:5 If I havewalked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to deceit; 
31:6 Let mebe weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity.
31:7 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walkedafter mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands; 
31:8 Thenlet me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be rooted out.
31:9 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laidwait at my neighbour's door; 
31:10 Then let my wife grind untoanother, and let others bow down upon her.
31:11 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to bepunished by the judges.
31:12 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would rootout all mine increase.
31:13 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of mymaidservant, when they contended with me; 
31:14 What then shall I dowhen God riseth up? and when he visiteth, what shall I answer him?
31:15 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not onefashion us in the womb?  
31:16 If I have withheld the poor from theirdesire, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail; 
31:17 Or haveeaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eatenthereof; 
31:18 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with afather, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;) 
31:19 If I haveseen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor without covering;
31:20 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed withthe fleece of my sheep; 
31:21 If I have lifted up my hand against thefatherless, when I saw my help in the gate: 
31:22 Then let mine armfall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be broken from the bone.
31:23 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason ofhis highness I could not endure.
31:24 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold, Thouart my confidence; 
31:25 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, andbecause mine hand had gotten much; 
31:26 If I beheld the sun when itshined, or the moon walking in brightness; 
31:27 And my heart hathbeen secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hand: 
31:28 Thisalso were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should havedenied the God that is above.
31:29 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or liftedup myself when evil found him: 
31:30 Neither have I suffered my mouthto sin by wishing a curse to his soul.
31:31 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of hisflesh!  we cannot be satisfied.
31:32 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my doorsto the traveller.
31:33 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine iniquityin my bosom: 
31:34 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contemptof families terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of thedoor?  
31:35 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that theAlmighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book.
31:36 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crownto me.
31:37 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a princewould I go near unto him.
31:38 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise thereofcomplain; 
31:39 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, orhave caused the owners thereof to lose their life: 
31:40 Let thistlesgrow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of barley.The words of Job are ended.
32:1 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteousin his own eyes.
32:2 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel theBuzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath kindled,because he justified himself rather than God.
32:3 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, becausethey had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.
32:4 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were elderthan he.
32:5 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of thesethree men, then his wrath was kindled.
32:6 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I amyoung, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shewyou mine opinion.
32:7 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teachwisdom.
32:8 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the Almightygiveth them understanding.
32:9 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understandjudgment.
32:10 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine opinion.
32:11 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,whilst ye searched out what to say.
32:12 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of youthat convinced Job, or that answered his words: 
32:13 Lest ye shouldsay, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth him down, not man.
32:14 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will Ianswer him with your speeches.
32:15 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off speaking.
32:16 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, andanswered no more;) 
32:17 I said, I will answer also my part, I alsowill shew mine opinion.
32:18 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.
32:19 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready toburst like new bottles.
32:20 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips andanswer.
32:21 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let megive flattering titles unto man.
32:22 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my makerwould soon take me away.
33:1 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to allmy words.
33:2 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in mymouth.
33:3 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lipsshall utter knowledge clearly.
33:4 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almightyhath given me life.
33:5 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me, standup.
33:6 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also amformed out of the clay.
33:7 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall myhand be heavy upon thee.
33:8 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard thevoice of thy words, saying, 
33:9 I am clean without transgression, Iam innocent; neither is there iniquity in me.
33:10 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for hisenemy, 
33:11 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all mypaths.
33:12 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that Godis greater than man.
33:13 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account ofany of his matters.
33:14 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.
33:15 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep fallethupon men, in slumberings upon the bed; 
33:16 Then he openeth the earsof men, and sealeth their instruction, 
33:17 That he may withdraw manfrom his purpose, and hide pride from man.
33:18 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life fromperishing by the sword.
33:19 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitudeof his bones with strong pain: 
33:20 So that his life abhorreth bread,and his soul dainty meat.
33:21 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and hisbones that were not seen stick out.
33:22 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to thedestroyers.
33:23 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among athousand, to shew unto man his uprightness: 
33:24 Then he is graciousunto him, and saith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I havefound a ransom.
33:25 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return tothe days of his youth: 
33:26 He shall pray unto God, and he will befavourable unto him: and he shall see his face with joy: for he willrender unto man his righteousness.
33:27 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, andperverted that which was right, and it profited me not; 
33:28 He willdeliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life shall see thelight.
33:29 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man, 
33:30 Tobring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with the light ofthe living.
33:31 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I willspeak.
33:32 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire tojustify thee.
33:33 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach theewisdom.
34:1 Furthermore Elihu answered and said, 
34:2 Hear my words, O yewise men; and give ear unto me, ye that have knowledge.
34:3 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.
34:4 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what isgood.
34:5 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away myjudgment.
34:6 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable withouttransgression.
34:7 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?  
34:8 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and walketh withwicked men.
34:9 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he shoulddelight himself with God.
34:10 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be itfrom God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty, that heshould commit iniquity.
34:11 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause everyman to find according to his ways.
34:12 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the Almightypervert judgment.
34:13 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath disposedthe whole world?  
34:14 If he set his heart upon man, if he gatherunto himself his spirit and his breath; 
34:15 All flesh shall perishtogether, and man shall turn again unto dust.
34:16 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the voiceof my words.
34:17 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemnhim that is most just?  
34:18 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou artwicked? and to princes, Ye are ungodly?  
34:19 How much less to himthat accepteth not the persons of princes, nor regardeth the rich morethan the poor? for they all are the work of his hands.
34:20 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled atmidnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away withouthand.
34:21 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all hisgoings.
34:22 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers ofiniquity may hide themselves.
34:23 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he shouldenter into judgment with God.
34:24 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and setothers in their stead.
34:25 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in thenight, so that they are destroyed.
34:26 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;
34:27 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any ofhis ways: 
34:28 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come untohim, and he heareth the cry of the afflicted.
34:29 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when hehideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be done against anation, or against a man only: 
34:30 That the hypocrite reign not,lest the people be ensnared.
34:31 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have bornechastisement, I will not offend any more: 
34:32 That which I see notteach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.
34:33 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I: thereforespeak what thou knowest.
34:34 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearkenunto me.
34:35 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were withoutwisdom.
34:36 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of hisanswers for wicked men.
34:37 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his handsamong us, and multiplieth his words against God.
35:1 Elihu spake moreover, and said, 
35:2 Thinkest thou this to beright, that thou saidst, My righteousness is more than God's?  
35:3 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and, What profitshall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?  
35:4 I will answer thee,and thy companions with thee.
35:5 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which arehigher than thou.
35:6 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thytransgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?  
35:7 If thoube righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thinehand?  
35:8 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thyrighteousness may profit the son of man.
35:9 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the oppressedto cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the mighty.
35:10 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in thenight; 
35:11 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, andmaketh us wiser than the fowls of heaven?  
35:12 There they cry, butnone giveth answer, because of the pride of evil men.
35:13 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almightyregard it.
35:14 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment isbefore him; therefore trust thou in him.
35:15 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger; yethe knoweth it not in great extremity: 
35:16 Therefore doth Job openhis mouth in vain; he multiplieth words without knowledge.
36:1 Elihu also proceeded, and said, 
36:2 Suffer me a little, and Iwill shew thee that I have yet to speak on God's behalf.
36:3 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascriberighteousness to my Maker.
36:4 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect inknowledge is with thee.
36:5 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty instrength and wisdom.
36:6 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to thepoor.
36:7 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kingsare they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever, and theyare exalted.
36:8 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords ofaffliction; 
36:9 Then he sheweth them their work, and theirtransgressions that they have exceeded.
36:10 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth thatthey return from iniquity.
36:11 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days inprosperity, and their years in pleasures.
36:12 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and theyshall die without knowledge.
36:13 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when hebindeth them.
36:14 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.
36:15 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their earsin oppression.
36:16 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into abroad place, where there is no straitness; and that which should beset on thy table should be full of fatness.
36:17 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment andjustice take hold on thee.
36:18 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with hisstroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.
36:19 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces ofstrength.
36:20 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.
36:21 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen ratherthan affliction.
36:22 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?  
36:23 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast wroughtiniquity?  
36:24 Remember that thou magnify his work, which menbehold.
36:25 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.
36:26 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can thenumber of his years be searched out.
36:27 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rainaccording to the vapour thereof: 
36:28 Which the clouds do drop anddistil upon man abundantly.
36:29 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or thenoise of his tabernacle?  
36:30 Behold, he spreadeth his light uponit, and covereth the bottom of the sea.
36:31 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in abundance.
36:32 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not toshine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.
36:33 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle alsoconcerning the vapour.
37:1 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his place.
37:2 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that goethout of his mouth.
37:3 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning untothe ends of the earth.
37:4 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of hisexcellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.
37:5 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doethhe, which we cannot comprehend.
37:6 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to thesmall rain, and to the great rain of his strength.
37:7 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know hiswork.
37:8 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.
37:9 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the north.
37:10 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of thewaters is straitened.
37:11 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth hisbright cloud: 
37:12 And it is turned round about by his counsels: thatthey may do whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the worldin the earth.
37:13 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his land,or for mercy.
37:14 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrousworks of God.
37:15 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light ofhis cloud to shine?  
37:16 Dost thou know the balancings of theclouds, the wondrous works of him which is perfect in knowledge?
37:17 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by thesouth wind?  
37:18 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which isstrong, and as a molten looking glass?  
37:19 Teach us what we shallsay unto him; for we cannot order our speech by reason of darkness.
37:20 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely heshall be swallowed up.
37:21 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds: butthe wind passeth, and cleanseth them.
37:22 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terriblemajesty.
37:23 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellentin power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will notafflict.
37:24 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wiseof heart.
38:1 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said, 
38:2 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?  
38:3 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, andanswer thou me.
38:4 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?declare, if thou hast understanding.
38:5 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hathstretched the line upon it?  
38:6 Whereupon are the foundationsthereof fastened? or who laid the corner stone thereof; 
38:7 When themorning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?
38:8 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if ithad issued out of the womb?  
38:9 When I made the cloud the garmentthereof, and thick darkness a swaddlingband for it, 
38:10 And brake upfor it my decreed place, and set bars and doors, 
38:11 And said,Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here shall thy proudwaves be stayed?  
38:12 Hast thou commanded the morning since thydays; and caused the dayspring to know his place; 
38:13 That it mighttake hold of the ends of the earth, that the wicked might be shakenout of it?  
38:14 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand asa garment.
38:15 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high armshall be broken.
38:16 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thouwalked in the search of the depth?  
38:17 Have the gates of death beenopened unto thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the shadow of death?
38:18 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thouknowest it all.
38:19 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,where is the place thereof, 
38:20 That thou shouldest take it to thebound thereof, and that thou shouldest know the paths to the housethereof?  
38:21 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? orbecause the number of thy days is great?  
38:22 Hast thou entered intothe treasures of the snow? or hast thou seen the treasures of thehail, 
38:23 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, againstthe day of battle and war?  
38:24 By what way is the light parted,which scattereth the east wind upon the earth?  
38:25 Who hath divideda watercourse for the overflowing of waters, or a way for thelightning of thunder; 
38:26 To cause it to rain on the earth, where noman is; on the wilderness, wherein there is no man; 
38:27 To satisfythe desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud of the tender herbto spring forth?  
38:28 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begottenthe drops of dew?  
38:29 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoaryfrost of heaven, who hath gendered it?  
38:30 The waters are hid aswith a stone, and the face of the deep is frozen.
38:31 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose thebands of Orion?  
38:32 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season?or canst thou guide Arcturus with his sons?  
38:33 Knowest thou theordinances of heaven? canst thou set the dominion thereof in theearth?  
38:34 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, thatabundance of waters may cover thee?  
38:35 Canst thou send lightnings,that they may go and say unto thee, Here we are?  
38:36 Who hath putwisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given understanding to theheart?  
38:37 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay thebottles of heaven, 
38:38 When the dust groweth into hardness, and theclods cleave fast together?  
38:39 Wilt thou hunt the prey for thelion? or fill the appetite of the young lions, 
38:40 When they couchin their dens, and abide in the covert to lie in wait?  
38:41 Whoprovideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry unto God,they wander for lack of meat.
39:1 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bringforth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?  
39:2 Canst thounumber the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou the time when theybring forth?  
39:3 They bow themselves, they bring forth their youngones, they cast out their sorrows.
39:4 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn; theygo forth, and return not unto them.
39:5 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the bandsof the wild ass?  
39:6 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and thebarren land his dwellings.
39:7 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he thecrying of the driver.
39:8 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth afterevery green thing.
39:9 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy crib?
39:10 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or willhe harrow the valleys after thee?  
39:11 Wilt thou trust him, becausehis strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?  
39:12 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and gather itinto thy barn?  
39:13 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks?or wings and feathers unto the ostrich?  
39:14 Which leaveth her eggsin the earth, and warmeth them in dust, 
39:15 And forgetteth that thefoot may crush them, or that the wild beast may break them.
39:16 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were nother's: her labour is in vain without fear; 
39:17 Because God hathdeprived her of wisdom, neither hath he imparted to her understanding.
39:18 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the horseand his rider.
39:19 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neckwith thunder?  
39:20 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? theglory of his nostrils is terrible.
39:21 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he goethon to meet the armed men.
39:22 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth heback from the sword.
39:23 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and theshield.
39:24 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neitherbelieveth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.
39:25 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the battleafar off, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting.
39:26 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings towardthe south?  
39:27 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make hernest on high?  
39:28 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon thecrag of the rock, and the strong place.
39:29 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar off.
39:30 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,there is she.
40:1 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said, 
40:2 Shall he thatcontendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he that reproveth God, lethim answer it.
40:3 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
40:4 Behold, I am vile;what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine hand upon my mouth.
40:5 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I willproceed no further.
40:6 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
40:7 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, anddeclare thou unto me.
40:8 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, thatthou mayest be righteous?  
40:9 Hast thou an arm like God? or canstthou thunder with a voice like him?  
40:10 Deck thyself now withmajesty and excellency; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
40:11 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that isproud, and abase him.
40:12 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and treaddown the wicked in their place.
40:13 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in secret.
40:14 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand cansave thee.
40:15 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass asan ox.
40:16 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in thenavel of his belly.
40:17 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones arewrapped together.
40:18 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like barsof iron.
40:19 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can makehis sword to approach unto him.
40:20 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beastsof the field play.
40:21 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, andfens.
40:22 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of thebrook compass him about.
40:23 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteththat he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
40:24 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
41:1 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with acord which thou lettest down?  
41:2 Canst thou put an hook into hisnose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?  
41:3 Will he make manysupplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto thee?  
41:4 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servantfor ever?  
41:5 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thoubind him for thy maidens?  
41:6 Shall the companions make a banquet ofhim? shall they part him among the merchants?  
41:7 Canst thou fillhis skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?  
41:8 Laythine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
41:9 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast downeven at the sight of him?  
41:10 None is so fierce that dare stir himup: who then is able to stand before me?  
41:11 Who hath prevented me,that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the whole heaven is mine.
41:12 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comelyproportion.
41:13 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to himwith his double bridle?  
41:14 Who can open the doors of his face? histeeth are terrible round about.
41:15 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal.
41:16 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
41:17 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that theycannot be sundered.
41:18 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like theeyelids of the morning.
41:19 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out.
41:20 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot orcaldron.
41:21 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.
41:22 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joybefore him.
41:23 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm inthemselves; they cannot be moved.
41:24 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of thenether millstone.
41:25 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason ofbreakings they purify themselves.
41:26 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, thedart, nor the habergeon.
41:27 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
41:28 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with himinto stubble.
41:29 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of aspear.
41:30 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed thingsupon the mire.
41:31 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like apot of ointment.
41:32 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep tobe hoary.
41:33 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
41:34 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the childrenof pride.
42:1 Then Job answered the LORD, and said, 
42:2 I know that thou canstdo every thing, and that no thought can be withholden from thee.
42:3 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore have Iuttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which Iknew not.
42:4 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,and declare thou unto me.
42:5 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine eyeseeth thee.
42:6 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.
42:7 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words untoJob, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindledagainst thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken ofme the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.
42:8 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and goto my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; andmy servant Job shall pray for you: for him will I accept: lest I dealwith you after your folly, in that ye have not spoken of me the thingwhich is right, like my servant Job.
42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar theNaamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them: theLORD also accepted Job.
42:10 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for hisfriends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.
42:11 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters,and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eatbread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted himover all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him: every man alsogave him a piece of money, and every one an earring of gold.
42:12 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than hisbeginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousandcamels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses.
42:13 He had also seven sons and three daughters.
42:14 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of thesecond, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.
42:15 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughtersof Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.
42:16 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw hissons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.
42:17 So Job died, being old and full of days.
