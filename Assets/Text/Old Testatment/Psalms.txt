1:1 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly,nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of thescornful.
1:2 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth hemeditate day and night.
1:3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, thatbringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall notwither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
1:4 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the winddriveth away.
1:5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinnersin the congregation of the righteous.
1:6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of theungodly shall perish.
2:1 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?
2:2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counseltogether, against the LORD, and against his anointed, saying,
2:3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords fromus.
2:4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall havethem in derision.
2:5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in hissore displeasure.
2:6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
2:7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou art mySon; this day have I begotten thee.
2:8 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thineinheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.
2:9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them inpieces like a potter's vessel.
2:10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges ofthe earth.
2:11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
2:12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way, whenhis wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they that put theirtrust in him.
3:1 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they thatrise up against me.
3:2 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him inGod.Selah.
3:3 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter upof mine head.
3:4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of hisholy hill. Selah.
3:5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
3:6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have setthemselves against me round about.
3:7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mineenemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of theungodly.
3:8 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thypeople.Selah.
4:1 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlargedme when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
4:2 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame? howlong will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.
4:3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly forhimself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
4:4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon yourbed, and be still. Selah.
4:5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in theLORD.
4:6 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift thouup the light of thy countenance upon us.
4:7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time thattheir corn and their wine increased.
4:8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, onlymakest me dwell in safety.
5:1 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
5:2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for untothee will I pray.
5:3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morningwill I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
5:4 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neithershall evil dwell with thee.
5:5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workersof iniquity.
5:6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will abhorthe bloody and deceitful man.
5:7 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thymercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
5:8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;make thy way straight before my face.
5:9 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part isvery wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter withtheir tongue.
5:10 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they haverebelled against thee.
5:11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let themever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also thatlove thy name be joyful in thee.
5:12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thoucompass him as with a shield.
6:1 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thyhot displeasure.
6:2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me; for mybones are vexed.
6:3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
6:4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies' sake.
6:5 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave whoshall give thee thanks?
6:6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim;I water my couch with my tears.
6:7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because ofall mine enemies.
6:8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hathheard the voice of my weeping.
6:9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive myprayer.
6:10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them returnand be ashamed suddenly.
7:1 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all themthat persecute me, and deliver me:
7:2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, whilethere is none to deliver.
7:3 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in myhands;
7:4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea,I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
7:5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him treaddown my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
7:6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rageof mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that thou hastcommanded.
7:7 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about: fortheir sakes therefore return thou on high.
7:8 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according to myrighteousness, and according to mine integrity that is in me.
7:9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establishthe just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
7:10 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.
7:11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked everyday.
7:12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, andmade it ready.
7:13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; heordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
7:14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief,and brought forth falsehood.
7:15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch whichhe made.
7:16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violentdealing shall come down upon his own pate.
7:17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and willsing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
8:1 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! whohast set thy glory above the heavens.
8:2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordainedstrength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemyand the avenger.
8:3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon andthe stars, which thou hast ordained;
8:4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,that thou visitest him?
8:5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hastcrowned him with glory and honour.
8:6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thouhast put all things under his feet:
8:7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
8:8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoeverpasseth through the paths of the seas.
8:9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
9:1 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forthall thy marvellous works.
9:2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thyname, O thou most High.
9:3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish atthy presence.
9:4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in thethrone judging right.
9:5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
9:6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thouhast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
9:7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his thronefor judgment.
9:8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall ministerjudgment to the people in uprightness.
9:9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge intimes of trouble.
9:10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: forthou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
9:11 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare amongthe people his doings.
9:12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: heforgetteth not the cry of the humble.
9:13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer ofthem that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
9:14 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughterof Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
9:15 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the netwhich they hid is their own foot taken.
9:16 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the wickedis snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
9:17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations thatforget God.
9:18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation ofthe poor shall not perish for ever.
9:19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged inthy sight.
9:20 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves tobe but men. Selah.
10:1 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself intimes of trouble?
10:2 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them betaken in the devices that they have imagined.
10:3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth thecovetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
10:4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seekafter God: God is not in all his thoughts.
10:5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out ofhis sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
10:6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shallnever be in adversity.
10:7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under histongue is mischief and vanity.
10:8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secretplaces doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set againstthe poor.
10:9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in waitto catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him intohis net.
10:10 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall byhis strong ones.
10:11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth hisface; he will never see it.
10:12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
10:13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in hisheart, Thou wilt not require it.
10:14 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, torequite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thouart the helper of the fatherless.
10:15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out hiswickedness till thou find none.
10:16 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished outof his land.
10:17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wiltprepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
10:18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of theearth may no more oppress.
11:1 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a birdto your mountain?
11:2 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrowupon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
11:3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven:his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
11:5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that lovethviolence his soul hateth.
11:6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and anhorrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.
11:7 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance dothbehold the upright.
12:1 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail fromamong the children of men.
12:2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flatteringlips and with a double heart do they speak.
12:3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue thatspeaketh proud things:
12:4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are ourown: who is lord over us?
12:5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, nowwill I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety from him thatpuffeth at him.
12:6 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in afurnace of earth, purified seven times.
12:7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from thisgeneration for ever.
12:8 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are exalted.
13:1 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wiltthou hide thy face from me?
13:2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in myheart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
13:3 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest Isleep the sleep of death;
13:4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those thattrouble me rejoice when I am moved.
13:5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thysalvation.
13:6 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully withme.
14:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They arecorrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that doethgood.
14:2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to seeif there were any that did understand, and seek God.
14:3 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
14:4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up mypeople as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
14:5 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation ofthe righteous.
14:6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is hisrefuge.
14:7 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when theLORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice,and Israel shall be glad.
15:1 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in thyholy hill?
15:2 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, andspeaketh the truth in his heart.
15:3 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to hisneighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.
15:4 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth themthat fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changethnot.
15:5 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh rewardagainst the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.
16:1 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.
16:2 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: mygoodness extendeth not to thee;
16:3 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, inwhom is all my delight.
16:4 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god:their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up theirnames into my lips.
16:5 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: thoumaintainest my lot.
16:6 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have agoodly heritage.
16:7 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins alsoinstruct me in the night seasons.
16:8 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my righthand, I shall not be moved.
16:9 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh alsoshall rest in hope.
16:10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thousuffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
16:11 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulnessof joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.
17:1 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto myprayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.
17:2 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyesbehold the things that are equal.
17:3 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the night;thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am purposed that mymouth shall not transgress.
17:4 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have keptme from the paths of the destroyer.
17:5 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.
17:6 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: inclinethine ear unto me, and hear my speech.
17:7 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thyright hand them which put their trust in thee from those that rise upagainst them.
17:8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thywings,
17:9 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, whocompass me about.
17:10 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they speakproudly.
17:11 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set theireyes bowing down to the earth;
17:12 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were ayoung lion lurking in secret places.
17:13 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soulfrom the wicked, which is thy sword:
17:14 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou fillestwith thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and leave the restof their substance to their babes.
17:15 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall besatisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.
18:1 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.
18:2 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God,my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of mysalvation, and my high tower.
18:3 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so shallI be saved from mine enemies.
18:4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly menmade me afraid.
18:5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of deathprevented me.
18:6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: heheard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, eveninto his ears.
18:7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of thehills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
18:8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of hismouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
18:9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was underhis feet.
18:10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon thewings of the wind.
18:11 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about himwere dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.
18:12 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,hail stones and coals of fire.
18:13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave hisvoice; hail stones and coals of fire.
18:14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot outlightnings, and discomfited them.
18:15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations ofthe world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of thebreath of thy nostrils.
18:16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
18:17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which hatedme: for they were too strong for me.
18:18 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was mystay.
18:19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,because he delighted in me.
18:20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according tothe cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
18:21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedlydeparted from my God.
18:22 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away hisstatutes from me.
18:23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mineiniquity.
18:24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to myrighteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
18:25 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with anupright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;
18:26 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the frowardthou wilt shew thyself froward.
18:27 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring downhigh looks.
18:28 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten mydarkness.
18:29 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have Ileaped over a wall.
18:30 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.
18:31 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?
18:32 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my wayperfect.
18:33 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my highplaces.
18:34 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken bymine arms.
18:35 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thyright hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me great.
18:36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not slip.
18:37 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did Iturn again till they were consumed.
18:38 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they arefallen under my feet.
18:39 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou hastsubdued under me those that rose up against me.
18:40 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I mightdestroy them that hate me.
18:41 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the LORD,but he answered them not.
18:42 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I didcast them out as the dirt in the streets.
18:43 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; andthou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I have notknown shall serve me.
18:44 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangersshall submit themselves unto me.
18:45 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their closeplaces.
18:46 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of mysalvation be exalted.
18:47 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.
18:48 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me upabove those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me from theviolent man.
18:49 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among theheathen, and sing praises unto thy name.
18:50 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy tohis anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.
19:1 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament shewethhis handywork.
19:2 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night shewethknowledge.
19:3 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
19:4 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words tothe end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the sun,
19:5 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoicethas a strong man to run a race.
19:6 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuitunto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: thetestimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.
19:8 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: thecommandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.
19:9 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the judgmentsof the LORD are true and righteous altogether.
19:10 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold:sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.
19:11 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of themthere is great reward.
19:12 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secretfaults.
19:13 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them nothave dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I shall beinnocent from the great transgression.
19:14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, beacceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.
20:1 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God ofJacob defend thee;
20:2 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out ofZion;
20:3 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;Selah.
20:4 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thycounsel.
20:5 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God wewill set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.
20:6 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear himfrom his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right hand.
20:7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will rememberthe name of the LORD our God.
20:8 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and standupright.
20:9 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.
21:1 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvationhow greatly shall he rejoice!
21:2 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholdenthe request of his lips. Selah.
21:3 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thousettest a crown of pure gold on his head.
21:4 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length ofdays for ever and ever.
21:5 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast thoulaid upon him.
21:6 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made himexceeding glad with thy countenance.
21:7 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of themost High he shall not be moved.
21:8 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand shallfind out those that hate thee.
21:9 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger:the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devourthem.
21:10 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seedfrom among the children of men.
21:11 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a mischievousdevice, which they are not able to perform.
21:12 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shaltmake ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
21:13 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we singand praise thy power.
22:1 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so farfrom helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
22:2 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in thenight season, and am not silent.
22:3 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
22:4 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst deliverthem.
22:5 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in thee,and were not confounded.
22:6 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised ofthe people.
22:7 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the lip,they shake the head, saying,
22:8 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him deliverhim, seeing he delighted in him.
22:9 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make mehope when I was upon my mother's breasts.
22:10 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from mymother's belly.
22:11 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none tohelp.
22:12 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have besetme round.
22:13 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and aroaring lion.
22:14 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.
22:15 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleavethto my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
22:16 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked haveinclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.
22:17 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.
22:18 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
22:19 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste theeto help me.
22:20 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of thedog.
22:21 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from thehorns of the unicorns.
22:22 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of thecongregation will I praise thee.
22:23 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
22:24 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of theafflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he criedunto him, he heard.
22:25 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will paymy vows before them that fear him.
22:26 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the LORDthat seek him: your heart shall live for ever.
22:27 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD:and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before thee.
22:28 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among thenations.
22:29 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all theythat go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none can keep alivehis own soul.
22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for ageneration.
22:31 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto apeople that shall be born, that he hath done this.
23:1 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
23:2 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me besidethe still waters.
23:3 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousnessfor his name's sake.
23:4 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, Iwill fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff theycomfort me.
23:5 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies:thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.
23:6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of mylife: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.
24:1 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world, andthey that dwell therein.
24:2 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon thefloods.
24:3 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand inhis holy place?
24:4 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not liftedup his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.
24:5 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousnessfrom the God of his salvation.
24:6 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy face,O Jacob. Selah.
24:7 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlastingdoors; and the King of glory shall come in.
24:8 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the LORDmighty in battle.
24:9 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlastingdoors; and the King of glory shall come in.
24:10 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King ofglory. Selah.
25:1 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.
25:2 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mineenemies triumph over me.
25:3 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be ashamedwhich transgress without cause.
25:4 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.
25:5 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of mysalvation; on thee do I wait all the day.
25:6 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;for they have been ever of old.
25:7 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness' sake, OLORD.
25:8 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners inthe way.
25:9 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teachhis way.
25:10 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as keephis covenant and his testimonies.
25:11 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it isgreat.
25:12 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in theway that he shall choose.
25:13 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit theearth.
25:14 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he willshew them his covenant.
25:15 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feetout of the net.
25:16 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate andafflicted.
25:17 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of mydistresses.
25:18 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my sins.
25:19 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me withcruel hatred.
25:20 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I putmy trust in thee.
25:21 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.
25:22 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.
26:1 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I havetrusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.
26:2 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.
26:3 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked inthy truth.
26:4 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in withdissemblers.
26:5 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sitwith the wicked.
26:6 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thinealtar, O LORD:
26:7 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell ofall thy wondrous works.
26:8 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the placewhere thine honour dwelleth.
26:9 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:
26:10 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full ofbribes.
26:11 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and bemerciful unto me.
26:12 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will Ibless the LORD.
27:1 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? theLORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?
27:2 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me toeat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.
27:3 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear:though war should rise against me, in this will I be confident.
27:4 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, tobehold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his temple.
27:5 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion: inthe secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upona rock.
27:6 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies roundabout me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy;I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.
27:7 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon me,and answer me.
27:8 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee, Thyface, LORD, will I seek.
27:9 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger:thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake me, O God of mysalvation.
27:10 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will takeme up.
27:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, becauseof mine enemies.
27:12 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for falsewitnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out cruelty.
27:13 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of theLORD in the land of the living.
27:14 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthenthine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.
28:1 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me: lest,if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down into the pit.
28:2 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when Ilift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.
28:3 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers ofiniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief is intheir hearts.
28:4 Give them according to their deeds, and according to thewickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of theirhands; render to them their desert.
28:5 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the operationof his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build them up.
28:6 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of mysupplications.
28:7 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him,and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with mysong will I praise him.
28:8 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of hisanointed.
28:9 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also, andlift them up for ever.
29:1 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory andstrength.
29:2 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the LORDin the beauty of holiness.
29:3 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glorythundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.
29:4 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is fullof majesty.
29:5 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD breakeththe cedars of Lebanon.
29:6 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion likea young unicorn.
29:7 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.
29:8 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shakeththe wilderness of Kadesh.
29:9 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and discovereththe forests: and in his temple doth every one speak of his glory.
29:10 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King forever.
29:11 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will blesshis people with peace.
30:1 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and hastnot made my foes to rejoice over me.
30:2 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.
30:3 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hastkept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.
30:4 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at theremembrance of his holiness.
30:5 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.
30:6 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.
30:7 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand strong:thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.
30:8 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made supplication.
30:9 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?
30:10 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.
30:11 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast putoff my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;
30:12 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not besilent.O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.
31:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:deliver me in thy righteousness.
31:2 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my strongrock, for an house of defence to save me.
31:3 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name'ssake lead me, and guide me.
31:4 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: forthou art my strength.
31:5 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O LORDGod of truth.
31:6 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in theLORD.
31:7 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast consideredmy trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;
31:8 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast setmy feet in a large room.
31:9 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye isconsumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.
31:10 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: mystrength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are consumed.
31:11 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among myneighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did see mewithout fled from me.
31:12 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a brokenvessel.
31:13 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:while they took counsel together against me, they devised to take awaymy life.
31:14 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.
31:15 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mineenemies, and from them that persecute me.
31:16 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thymercies' sake.
31:17 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee: letthe wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the grave.
31:18 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievousthings proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
31:19 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for themthat fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in theebefore the sons of men!
31:20 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from thepride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from thestrife of tongues.
31:21 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellouskindness in a strong city.
31:22 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when I criedunto thee.
31:23 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth thefaithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.
31:24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all yethat hope in the LORD.
32:1 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin iscovered.
32:2 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity, andin whose spirit there is no guile.
32:3 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring allthe day long.
32:4 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture isturned into the drought of summer. Selah.
32:5 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid.I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD; and thouforgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.
32:6 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a timewhen thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great waters theyshall not come nigh unto him.
32:7 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.
32:8 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou shaltgo: I will guide thee with mine eye.
32:9 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have nounderstanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle, lestthey come near unto thee.
32:10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in theLORD, mercy shall compass him about.
32:11 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout forjoy, all ye that are upright in heart.
33:1 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for theupright.
33:2 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and aninstrument of ten strings.
33:3 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.
33:4 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done intruth.
33:5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of thegoodness of the LORD.
33:6 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the hostof them by the breath of his mouth.
33:7 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he layethup the depth in storehouses.
33:8 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of theworld stand in awe of him.
33:9 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood fast.
33:10 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: hemaketh the devices of the people of none effect.
33:11 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of hisheart to all generations.
33:12 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people whomhe hath chosen for his own inheritance.
33:13 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men.
33:14 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all theinhabitants of the earth.
33:15 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all theirworks.
33:16 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty manis not delivered by much strength.
33:17 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliverany by his great strength.
33:18 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, uponthem that hope in his mercy;
33:19 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive infamine.
33:20 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.
33:21 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted inhis holy name.
33:22 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in thee.
34:1 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall continuallybe in my mouth.
34:2 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall hearthereof, and be glad.
34:3 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name together.
34:4 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all myfears.
34:5 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces werenot ashamed.
34:6 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out ofall his troubles.
34:7 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear him,and delivereth them.
34:8 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man thattrusteth in him.
34:9 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them thatfear him.
34:10 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seekthe LORD shall not want any good thing.
34:11 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear ofthe LORD.
34:12 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that hemay see good?
34:13 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.
34:14 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.
34:15 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears areopen unto their cry.
34:16 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut offthe remembrance of them from the earth.
34:17 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them outof all their troubles.
34:18 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; andsaveth such as be of a contrite spirit.
34:19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORDdelivereth him out of them all.
34:20 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.
34:21 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteousshall be desolate.
34:22 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of themthat trust in him shall be desolate.
35:1 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fightagainst them that fight against me.
35:2 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
35:3 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them thatpersecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.
35:4 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul:let them be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.
35:5 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of theLORD chase them.
35:6 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the LORDpersecute them.
35:7 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, whichwithout cause they have digged for my soul.
35:8 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net thathe hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.
35:9 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in hissalvation.
35:10 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, whichdeliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poorand the needy from him that spoileth him?
35:11 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things thatI knew not.
35:12 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
35:13 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth: Ihumbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into mine ownbosom.
35:14 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: Ibowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.
35:15 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselvestogether: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together against me,and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased not:
35:16 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me withtheir teeth.
35:17 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from theirdestructions, my darling from the lions.
35:18 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will praisethee among much people.
35:19 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a cause.
35:20 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful mattersagainst them that are quiet in the land.
35:21 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,aha, our eye hath seen it.
35:22 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be notfar from me.
35:23 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,my God and my Lord.
35:24 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and letthem not rejoice over me.
35:25 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: letthem not say, We have swallowed him up.
35:26 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together thatrejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and dishonourthat magnify themselves against me.
35:27 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteouscause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be magnified, whichhath pleasure in the prosperity of his servant.
35:28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praiseall the day long.
36:1 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that thereis no fear of God before his eyes.
36:2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity befound to be hateful.
36:3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left offto be wise, and to do good.
36:4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a waythat is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
36:5 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulnessreacheth unto the clouds.
36:6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments area great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.
36:7 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore thechildren of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.
36:8 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house;and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.
36:9 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we seelight.
36:10 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and thyrighteousness to the upright in heart.
36:11 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the handof the wicked remove me.
36:12 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,and shall not be able to rise.
37:1 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou enviousagainst the workers of iniquity.
37:2 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as thegreen herb.
37:3 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the land,and verily thou shalt be fed.
37:4 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee thedesires of thine heart.
37:5 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shallbring it to pass.
37:6 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and thyjudgment as the noonday.
37:7 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyselfbecause of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man whobringeth wicked devices to pass.
37:8 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any wiseto do evil.
37:9 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon theLORD, they shall inherit the earth.
37:10 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thoushalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.
37:11 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delightthemselves in the abundance of peace.
37:12 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him withhis teeth.
37:13 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day iscoming.
37:14 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow, tocast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of uprightconversation.
37:15 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bowsshall be broken.
37:16 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches ofmany wicked.
37:17 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORDupholdeth the righteous.
37:18 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their inheritanceshall be for ever.
37:19 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days offamine they shall be satisfied.
37:20 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shallbe as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall theyconsume away.
37:21 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteoussheweth mercy, and giveth.
37:22 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and theythat be cursed of him shall be cut off.
37:23 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and hedelighteth in his way.
37:24 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the LORDupholdeth him with his hand.
37:25 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen therighteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.
37:26 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.
37:27 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.
37:28 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints; theyare preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall be cut off.
37:29 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein forever.
37:30 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tonguetalketh of judgment.
37:31 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shallslide.
37:32 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.
37:33 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when heis judged.
37:34 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee toinherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.
37:35 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himselflike a green bay tree.
37:36 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him, buthe could not be found.
37:37 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end ofthat man is peace.
37:38 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end ofthe wicked shall be cut off.
37:39 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is theirstrength in the time of trouble.
37:40 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall deliverthem from the wicked, and save them, because they trust in him.
38:1 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy hotdispleasure.
38:2 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
38:3 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neitheris there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
38:4 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy burdenthey are too heavy for me.
38:5 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
38:6 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the daylong.
38:7 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is nosoundness in my flesh.
38:8 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of thedisquietness of my heart.
38:9 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hidfrom thee.
38:10 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light ofmine eyes, it also is gone from me.
38:11 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and mykinsmen stand afar off.
38:12 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and theythat seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine deceits allthe day long.
38:13 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man thatopeneth not his mouth.
38:14 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are noreproofs.
38:15 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.
38:16 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me:when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.
38:17 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
38:18 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
38:19 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they thathate me wrongfully are multiplied.
38:20 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;because I follow the thing that good is.
38:21 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.
38:22 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
39:1 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with mytongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is beforeme.
39:2 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and mysorrow was stirred.
39:3 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned:then spake I with my tongue,
39:4 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, whatit is: that I may know how frail I am.
39:5 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age isas nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state isaltogether vanity.Selah.
39:6 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they aredisquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who shallgather them.
39:7 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the reproachof the foolish.
39:9 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
39:10 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow ofthine hand.
39:11 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thoumakest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every man isvanity. Selah.
39:12 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thypeace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, asall my fathers were.
39:13 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, andbe no more.
40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, andheard my cry.
40:2 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miryclay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
40:3 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God:many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.
40:4 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, andrespecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
40:5 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hastdone, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be reckonedup in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak of them, they aremore than can be numbered.
40:6 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thouopened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required.
40:7 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is writtenof me,
40:8 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within myheart.
40:9 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, Ihave not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.
40:10 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I havedeclared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not concealed thylovingkindness and thy truth from the great congregation.
40:11 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thylovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.
40:12 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquitieshave taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up; they aremore than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart faileth me.
40:13 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to helpme.
40:14 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after mysoul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame thatwish me evil.
40:15 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say untome, Aha, aha.
40:16 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: letsuch as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be magnified.
40:17 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou artmy help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.
41:1 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliverhim in time of trouble.
41:2 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall beblessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto the will ofhis enemies.
41:3 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thouwilt make all his bed in his sickness.
41:4 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I havesinned against thee.
41:5 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his nameperish?
41:6 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart gatherethiniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth it.
41:7 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do theydevise my hurt.
41:8 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now thathe lieth he shall rise up no more.
41:9 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eatof my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
41:10 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that Imay requite them.
41:11 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy dothnot triumph over me.
41:12 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settestme before thy face for ever.
41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and toeverlasting. Amen, and Amen.
42:1 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soulafter thee, O God.
42:2 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I comeand appear before God?
42:3 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continuallysay unto me, Where is thy God?
42:4 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I hadgone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, withthe voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept holyday.
42:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted inme?  hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the help of hiscountenance.
42:6 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will Iremember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, from thehill Mizar.
42:7 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all thywaves and thy billows are gone over me.
42:8 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, andin the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God ofmy life.
42:9 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go Imourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
42:10 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; whilethey say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
42:11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquietedwithin me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is thehealth of my countenance, and my God.
43:1 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation: Odeliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.
43:2 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me off?why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
43:3 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let thembring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.
43:4 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding joy:yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.
43:5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquietedwithin me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the healthof my countenance, and my God.
44:1 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.
44:2 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and plantedstthem; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast them out.
44:3 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and thinearm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou hadst a favourunto them.
44:4 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.
44:5 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name willwe tread them under that rise up against us.
44:6 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save me.
44:7 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them toshame that hated us.
44:8 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for ever.Selah.
44:9 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not forthwith our armies.
44:10 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which hateus spoil for themselves.
44:11 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hastscattered us among the heathen.
44:12 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thywealth by their price.
44:13 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and aderision to them that are round about us.
44:14 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the headamong the people.
44:15 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my facehath covered me,
44:16 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by reasonof the enemy and avenger.
44:17 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.
44:18 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declinedfrom thy way;
44:19 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, andcovered us with the shadow of death.
44:20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out ourhands to a strange god;
44:21 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of theheart.
44:22 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are countedas sheep for the slaughter.
44:23 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off forever.
44:24 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our afflictionand our oppression?
44:25 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth untothe earth.
44:26 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.
45:1 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things which Ihave made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a ready writer.
45:2 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured intothy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.
45:3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory andthy majesty.
45:4 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth andmeekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach theeterrible things.
45:5 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;whereby the people fall under thee.
45:6 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thykingdom is a right sceptre.
45:7 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore God,thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thyfellows.
45:8 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out ofthe ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.
45:9 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy righthand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.
45:10 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear; forgetalso thine own people, and thy father's house;
45:11 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy Lord;and worship thou him.
45:12 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even therich among the people shall intreat thy favour.
45:13 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is ofwrought gold.
45:14 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework: thevirgins her companions that follow her shall be brought unto thee.
45:15 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shallenter into the king's palace.
45:16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayestmake princes in all the earth.
45:17 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.
46:1 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
46:2 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, andthough the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;
46:3 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though themountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.
46:4 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city ofGod, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.
46:5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shallhelp her, and that right early.
46:6 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his voice,the earth melted.
46:7 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.Selah.
46:8 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath madein the earth.
46:9 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breakeththe bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the chariot inthe fire.
46:10 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among theheathen, I will be exalted in the earth.
46:11 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.Selah.
47:1 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voiceof triumph.
47:2 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over allthe earth.
47:3 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under ourfeet.
47:4 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacobwhom he loved. Selah.
47:5 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of atrumpet.
47:6 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,sing praises.
47:7 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises withunderstanding.
47:8 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of hisholiness.
47:9 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the peopleof the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth belong unto God:he is greatly exalted.
48:1 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of ourGod, in the mountain of his holiness.
48:2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mountZion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.
48:3 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.
48:4 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.
48:5 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, andhasted away.
48:6 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman intravail.
48:7 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.
48:8 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD ofhosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah.
48:9 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of thytemple.
48:10 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends ofthe earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.
48:11 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,because of thy judgments.
48:12 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towersthereof.
48:13 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye maytell it to the generation following.
48:14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our guideeven unto death.
49:1 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of theworld:
49:2 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.
49:3 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heartshall be of understanding.
49:4 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark sayingupon the harp.
49:5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity ofmy heels shall compass me about?
49:6 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in themultitude of their riches;
49:7 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to Goda ransom for him:
49:8 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth forever:)
49:9 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.
49:10 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and thebrutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.
49:11 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue forever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call theirlands after their own names.
49:12 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like thebeasts that perish.
49:13 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve theirsayings. Selah.
49:14 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on them;and the upright shall have dominion over them in the morning; andtheir beauty shall consume in the grave from their dwelling.
49:15 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for heshall receive me. Selah.
49:16 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of hishouse is increased;
49:17 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shallnot descend after him.
49:18 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praisethee, when thou doest well to thyself.
49:19 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall neversee light.
49:20 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the beaststhat perish.
50:1 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the earthfrom the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.
50:2 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
50:3 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shalldevour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round about him.
50:4 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth, thathe may judge his people.
50:5 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made acovenant with me by sacrifice.
50:6 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is judgehimself. Selah.
50:7 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will testifyagainst thee: I am God, even thy God.
50:8 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burntofferings, to have been continually before me.
50:9 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of thyfolds.
50:10 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon athousand hills.
50:11 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts ofthe field are mine.
50:12 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is mine,and the fulness thereof.
50:13 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?
50:14 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the mostHigh:
50:15 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee, andthou shalt glorify me.
50:16 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declaremy statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy mouth?
50:17 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behindthee.
50:18 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, andhast been partaker with adulterers.
50:19 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.
50:20 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderestthine own mother's son.
50:21 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou thoughtestthat I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I will reprove thee,and set them in order before thine eyes.
50:22 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you inpieces, and there be none to deliver.
50:23 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that orderethhis conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.
51:1 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out mytransgressions.
51:2 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
51:3 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever beforeme.
51:4 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thysight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest, and beclear when thou judgest.
51:5 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my motherconceive me.
51:6 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in thehidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.
51:7 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I shallbe whiter than snow.
51:8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hastbroken may rejoice.
51:9 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
51:10 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spiritwithin me.
51:11 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spiritfrom me.
51:12 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thyfree spirit.
51:13 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall beconverted unto thee.
51:14 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of mysalvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy righteousness.
51:15 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thypraise.
51:16 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thoudelightest not in burnt offering.
51:17 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and acontrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.
51:18 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls ofJerusalem.
51:19 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness,with burnt offering and whole burnt offering: then shall they offerbullocks upon thine altar.
52:1 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the goodnessof God endureth continually.
52:2 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, workingdeceitfully.
52:3 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to speakrighteousness. Selah.
52:4 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.
52:5 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take theeaway, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee out ofthe land of the living. Selah.
52:6 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him:
52:7 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but trustedin the abundance of his riches, and strengthened himself in hiswickedness.
52:8 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust inthe mercy of God for ever and ever.
52:9 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and Iwill wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.
53:1 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt arethey, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doethgood.
53:2 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see ifthere were any that did understand, that did seek God.
53:3 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether becomefilthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.
53:4 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my peopleas they eat bread: they have not called upon God.
53:5 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hathscattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou hast putthem to shame, because God hath despised them.
53:6 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Godbringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, andIsrael shall be glad.
54:1 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
54:3 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek aftermy soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.
54:4 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold mysoul.
54:5 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thytruth.
54:6 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, OLORD; for it is good.
54:7 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hathseen his desire upon mine enemies.
55:1 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from mysupplication.
55:2 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make anoise;
55:3 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression ofthe wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath they hate me.
55:4 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death arefallen upon me.
55:5 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hathoverwhelmed me.
55:6 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I flyaway, and be at rest.
55:7 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.Selah.
55:8 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
55:9 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seenviolence and strife in the city.
55:10 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: mischiefalso and sorrow are in the midst of it.
55:11 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart notfrom her streets.
55:12 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could haveborne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himselfagainst me; then I would have hid myself from him:
55:13 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mineacquaintance.
55:14 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of Godin company.
55:15 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell:for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.
55:16 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
55:17 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:and he shall hear my voice.
55:18 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that wasagainst me: for there were many with me.
55:19 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
55:20 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace withhim: he hath broken his covenant.
55:21 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was inhis heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they drawn swords.
55:22 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: heshall never suffer the righteous to be moved.
55:23 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit ofdestruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half theirdays; but I will trust in thee.
56:1 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; hefighting daily oppresseth me.
56:2 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many thatfight against me, O thou most High.
56:3 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
56:4 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I willnot fear what flesh can do unto me.
56:5 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against mefor evil.
56:6 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they markmy steps, when they wait for my soul.
56:7 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down thepeople, O God.
56:8 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:are they not in thy book?
56:9 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this Iknow; for God is for me.
56:10 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise hisword.
56:11 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can dounto me.
56:12 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.
56:13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thoudeliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in the lightof the living?
57:1 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soultrusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make myrefuge, until these calamities be overpast.
57:2 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth allthings for me.
57:3 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of himthat would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy andhis truth.
57:4 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set onfire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, andtheir tongue a sharp sword.
57:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be aboveall the earth.
57:6 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they arefallen themselves. Selah.
57:7 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and givepraise.
57:8 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awakeearly.
57:9 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing untothee among the nations.
57:10 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto theclouds.
57:11 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory beabove all the earth.
58:1 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judgeuprightly, O ye sons of men?
58:2 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of yourhands in the earth.
58:3 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon asthey be born, speaking lies.
58:4 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like thedeaf adder that stoppeth her ear;
58:5 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming neverso wisely.
58:6 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the greatteeth of the young lions, O LORD.
58:7 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when hebendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in pieces.
58:8 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away: likethe untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the sun.
58:9 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away aswith a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
58:10 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: heshall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.
58:11 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for therighteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.
59:1 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them thatrise up against me.
59:2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloodymen.
59:3 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gatheredagainst me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.
59:4 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to helpme, and behold.
59:5 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake tovisit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked transgressors.Selah.
59:6 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and goround about the city.
59:7 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in theirlips: for who, say they, doth hear?
59:8 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all theheathen in derision.
59:9 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is mydefence.
59:10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see mydesire upon mine enemies.
59:11 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy power;and bring them down, O Lord our shield.
59:12 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let themeven be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying which theyspeak.
59:13 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: andlet them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the earth.Selah.
59:14 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like adog, and go round about the city.
59:15 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be notsatisfied.
59:16 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thymercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge in theday of my trouble.
59:17 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,and the God of my mercy.
60:1 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hastbeen displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
60:2 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: healthe breaches thereof; for it shaketh.
60:3 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us todrink the wine of astonishment.
60:4 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may bedisplayed because of the truth. Selah.
60:5 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, andhear me.
60:6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divideShechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is thestrength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
60:8 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia,triumph thou because of me.
60:9 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me intoEdom?
60:10 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O God,which didst not go out with our armies?
60:11 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
60:12 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall treaddown our enemies.
61:1 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
61:2 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart isoverwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.
61:3 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from theenemy.
61:4 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in thecovert of thy wings. Selah.
61:5 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me theheritage of those that fear thy name.
61:6 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as manygenerations.
61:7 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,which may preserve him.
61:8 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may dailyperform my vows.
62:1 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.
62:2 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shallnot be greatly moved.
62:3 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall beslain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a totteringfence.
62:4 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: theydelight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly.Selah.
62:5 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
62:6 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shallnot be moved.
62:7 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, andmy refuge, is in God.
62:8 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart beforehim: God is a refuge for us. Selah.
62:9 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are alie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether lighter thanvanity.
62:10 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: ifriches increase, set not your heart upon them.
62:11 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that powerbelongeth unto God.
62:12 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest toevery man according to his work.
63:1 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul thirstethfor thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and thirsty land, whereno water is;
63:2 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in thesanctuary.
63:3 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shallpraise thee.
63:4 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands inthy name.
63:5 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and mymouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:
63:6 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in thenight watches.
63:7 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thywings will I rejoice.
63:8 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth me.
63:9 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into thelower parts of the earth.
63:10 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.
63:11 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth byhim shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall bestopped.
64:1 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear ofthe enemy.
64:2 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from theinsurrection of the workers of iniquity:
64:3 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoottheir arrows, even bitter words:
64:4 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do theyshoot at him, and fear not.
64:5 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune oflaying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?
64:6 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart, is deep.
64:7 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they bewounded.
64:8 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves: allthat see them shall flee away.
64:9 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; forthey shall wisely consider of his doing.
64:10 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him;and all the upright in heart shall glory.
65:1 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall thevow be performed.
65:2 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
65:3 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thoushalt purge them away.
65:4 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approachunto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be satisfied withthe goodness of thy house, even of thy holy temple.
65:5 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God ofour salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth,and of them that are afar off upon the sea:
65:6 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girdedwith power:
65:7 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves,and the tumult of the people.
65:8 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thytokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening torejoice.
65:9 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly enrichestit with the river of God, which is full of water: thou preparest themcorn, when thou hast so provided for it.
65:10 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest thefurrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou blessest thespringing thereof.
65:11 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths dropfatness.
65:12 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the littlehills rejoice on every side.
65:13 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also arecovered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
66:1 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:
66:2 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.
66:3 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through thegreatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves untothee.
66:4 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee; theyshall sing to thy name. Selah.
66:5 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing towardthe children of men.
66:6 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood onfoot: there did we rejoice in him.
66:7 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: letnot the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.
66:8 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise tobe heard:
66:9 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to bemoved.
66:10 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silveris tried.
66:11 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon ourloins.
66:12 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went throughfire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a wealthyplace.
66:13 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay theemy vows,
66:14 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I wasin trouble.
66:15 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with theincense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.
66:16 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what hehath done for my soul.
66:17 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with mytongue.
66:18 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:
66:19 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice ofmy prayer.
66:20 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor hismercy from me.
67:1 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face toshine upon us; Selah.
67:2 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among allnations.
67:3 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praisethee.
67:4 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt judgethe people righteously, and govern the nations upon earth. Selah.
67:5 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praisethee.
67:6 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our ownGod, shall bless us.
67:7 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear him.
68:1 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also thathate him flee before him.
68:2 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax meltethbefore the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.
68:3 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God: yea,let them exceedingly rejoice.
68:4 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that ridethupon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.
68:5 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God inhis holy habitation.
68:6 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those whichare bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry land.
68:7 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou didstmarch through the wilderness; Selah:
68:8 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God:even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel.
68:9 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didstconfirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.
68:10 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast preparedof thy goodness for the poor.
68:11 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those thatpublished it.
68:12 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at homedivided the spoil.
68:13 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the wingsof a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with yellow gold.
68:14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow inSalmon.
68:15 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as thehill of Bashan.
68:16 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God desirethto dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.
68:17 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands ofangels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy place.
68:18 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious also, thatthe LORD God might dwell among them.
68:19 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, eventhe God of our salvation. Selah.
68:20 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD theLord belong the issues from death.
68:21 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy scalpof such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.
68:22 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring mypeople again from the depths of the sea:
68:23 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, andthe tongue of thy dogs in the same.
68:24 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God, myKing, in the sanctuary.
68:25 The singers went before, the players on instruments followedafter; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.
68:26 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from thefountain of Israel.
68:27 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of Judahand their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the princes ofNaphtali.
68:28 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, thatwhich thou hast wrought for us.
68:29 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presentsunto thee.
68:30 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls, withthe calves of the people, till every one submit himself with pieces ofsilver: scatter thou the people that delight in war.
68:31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch outher hands unto God.
68:32 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto theLord; Selah:
68:33 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were ofold; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.
68:34 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel, andhis strength is in the clouds.
68:35 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God ofIsrael is he that giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessedbe God.
69:1 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.
69:2 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come intodeep waters, where the floods overflow me.
69:3 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail whileI wait for my God.
69:4 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of minehead: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies wrongfully, aremighty: then I restored that which I took not away.
69:5 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid fromthee.
69:6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be ashamedfor my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, OGod of Israel.
69:7 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered myface.
69:8 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto mymother's children.
69:9 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the reproachesof them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.
69:10 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to myreproach.
69:11 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb tothem.
69:12 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the songof the drunkards.
69:13 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an acceptabletime: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me, in the truth ofthy salvation.
69:14 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me bedelivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.
69:15 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep swallowme up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.
69:16 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto meaccording to the multitude of thy tender mercies.
69:17 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:hear me speedily.
69:18 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because ofmine enemies.
69:19 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:mine adversaries are all before thee.
69:20 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and Ilooked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for comforters,but I found none.
69:21 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gaveme vinegar to drink.
69:22 Let their table become a snare before them: and that whichshould have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.
69:23 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make theirloins continually to shake.
69:24 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful angertake hold of them.
69:25 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in theirtents.
69:26 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk tothe grief of those whom thou hast wounded.
69:27 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into thyrighteousness.
69:28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not bewritten with the righteous.
69:29 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me upon high.
69:30 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify himwith thanksgiving.
69:31 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullockthat hath horns and hoofs.
69:32 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shalllive that seek God.
69:33 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his prisoners.
69:34 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thingthat moveth therein.
69:35 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah: thatthey may dwell there, and have it in possession.
69:36 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they thatlove his name shall dwell therein.
70:1 Make haste, O God, to deliver me; make haste to help me, O Lord.
70:2 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul: letthem be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire my hurt.
70:3 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,Aha, aha.
70:4 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and letsuch as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be magnified.
70:5 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art myhelp and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.
71:1 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put toconfusion.
71:2 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape: inclinethine ear unto me, and save me.
71:3 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually resort:thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art my rock and myfortress.
71:4 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of thehand of the unrighteous and cruel man.
71:5 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from myyouth.
71:6 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he thattook me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be continually ofthee.
71:7 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.
71:8 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour allthe day.
71:9 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when mystrength faileth.
71:10 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for mysoul take counsel together,
71:11 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for thereis none to deliver him.
71:12 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.
71:13 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to mysoul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that seek myhurt.
71:14 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more andmore.
71:15 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvationall the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.
71:16 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mentionof thy righteousness, even of thine only.
71:17 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have Ideclared thy wondrous works.
71:18 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy powerto every one that is to come.
71:19 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done greatthings: O God, who is like unto thee!
71:20 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shaltquicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths of theearth.
71:21 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every side.
71:22 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O myGod: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One of Israel.
71:23 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and mysoul, which thou hast redeemed.
71:24 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day long:for they are confounded, for they are brought unto shame, that seek myhurt.
72:1 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness untothe king's son.
72:2 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor withjudgment.
72:3 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the littlehills, by righteousness.
72:4 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the childrenof the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
72:5 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,throughout all generations.
72:6 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers thatwater the earth.
72:7 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peaceso long as the moon endureth.
72:8 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the riverunto the ends of the earth.
72:9 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and hisenemies shall lick the dust.
72:10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents: thekings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.
72:11 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shallserve him.
72:12 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,and him that hath no helper.
72:13 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls ofthe needy.
72:14 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: andprecious shall their blood be in his sight.
72:15 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold ofSheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and daily shallhe be praised.
72:16 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top ofthe mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and they ofthe city shall flourish like grass of the earth.
72:17 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued aslong as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations shallcall him blessed.
72:18 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doethwondrous things.
72:19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the wholeearth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.
72:20 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
73:1 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a cleanheart.
73:2 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well nighslipped.
73:3 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity ofthe wicked.
73:4 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength isfirm.
73:5 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plaguedlike other men.
73:6 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violencecovereth them as a garment.
73:7 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heartcould wish.
73:8 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression: theyspeak loftily.
73:9 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tonguewalketh through the earth.
73:10 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup arewrung out to them.
73:11 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in themost High?
73:12 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; theyincrease in riches.
73:13 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands ininnocency.
73:14 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened everymorning.
73:15 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against thegeneration of thy children.
73:16 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;
73:17 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I theirend.
73:18 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedstthem down into destruction.
73:19 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they areutterly consumed with terrors.
73:20 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest, thoushalt despise their image.
73:21 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.
73:22 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.
73:23 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me bymy right hand.
73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive meto glory.
73:25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earththat I desire beside thee.
73:26 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of myheart, and my portion for ever.
73:27 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hastdestroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.
73:28 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trustin the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.
74:1 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine angersmoke against the sheep of thy pasture?
74:2 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old; therod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this mount Zion,wherein thou hast dwelt.
74:3 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all thatthe enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.
74:4 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set uptheir ensigns for signs.
74:5 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon thethick trees.
74:6 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with axesand hammers.
74:7 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled bycasting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.
74:8 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: theyhave burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.
74:9 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither isthere among us any that knoweth how long.
74:10 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemyblaspheme thy name for ever?
74:11 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it outof thy bosom.
74:12 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of theearth.
74:13 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest theheads of the dragons in the waters.
74:14 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him tobe meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.
74:15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst upmighty rivers.
74:16 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast preparedthe light and the sun.
74:17 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast madesummer and winter.
74:18 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and thatthe foolish people have blasphemed thy name.
74:19 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude ofthe wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.
74:20 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the earthare full of the habitations of cruelty.
74:21 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needypraise thy name.
74:22 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolishman reproacheth thee daily.
74:23 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those thatrise up against thee increaseth continually.
75:1 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks:for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.
75:2 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
75:3 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I bearup the pillars of it. Selah.
75:4 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,Lift not up the horn:
75:5 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.
75:6 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,nor from the south.
75:7 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth upanother.
75:8 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red;it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same: but the dregsthereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring them out, and drinkthem.
75:9 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God ofJacob.
75:10 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the hornsof the righteous shall be exalted.
76:1 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.
76:2 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion.
76:3 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the sword,and the battle. Selah.
76:4 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of prey.
76:5 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: andnone of the men of might have found their hands.
76:6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse arecast into a dead sleep.
76:7 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy sightwhen once thou art angry?
76:8 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earthfeared, and was still,
76:9 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.Selah.
76:10 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder ofwrath shalt thou restrain.
76:11 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round abouthim bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.
76:12 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to thekings of the earth.
77:1 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; andhe gave ear unto me.
77:2 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in thenight, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.
77:3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spiritwas overwhelmed. Selah.
77:4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannotspeak.
77:5 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
77:6 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mineown heart: and my spirit made diligent search.
77:7 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable nomore?
77:8 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail forevermore?
77:9 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up histender mercies? Selah.
77:10 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the yearsof the right hand of the most High.
77:11 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will rememberthy wonders of old.
77:12 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
77:13 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God asour God?
77:14 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thystrength among the people.
77:15 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacoband Joseph. Selah.
77:16 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they wereafraid: the depths also were troubled.
77:17 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thinearrows also went abroad.
77:18 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightningslightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.
77:19 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thyfootsteps are not known.
77:20 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses andAaron.
78:1 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the wordsof my mouth.
78:2 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings ofold:
78:3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
78:4 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to thegeneration to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength, and hiswonderful works that he hath done.
78:5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law inIsrael, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make themknown to their children:
78:6 That the generation to come might know them, even the childrenwhich should be born; who should arise and declare them to theirchildren:
78:7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the worksof God, but keep his commandments:
78:8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebelliousgeneration; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whosespirit was not stedfast with God.
78:9 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows, turnedback in the day of battle.
78:10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in hislaw;
78:11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.
78:12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in theland of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.
78:13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he madethe waters to stand as an heap.
78:14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the nightwith a light of fire.
78:15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as outof the great depths.
78:16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters torun down like rivers.
78:17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most Highin the wilderness.
78:18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for theirlust.
78:19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a tablein the wilderness?
78:20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and thestreams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide flesh forhis people?
78:21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire waskindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
78:22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in hissalvation:
78:23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened thedoors of heaven,
78:24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given themof the corn of heaven.
78:25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
78:26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his powerhe brought in the south wind.
78:27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls likeas the sand of the sea:
78:28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about theirhabitations.
78:29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them theirown desire;
78:30 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meatwas yet in their mouths,
78:31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
78:32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for hiswondrous works.
78:33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their yearsin trouble.
78:34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned andenquired early after God.
78:35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high Godtheir redeemer.
78:36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and theylied unto him with their tongues.
78:37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were theystedfast in his covenant.
78:38 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, anddestroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and didnot stir up all his wrath.
78:39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passethaway, and cometh not again.
78:40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve himin the desert!
78:41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy Oneof Israel.
78:42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered themfrom the enemy.
78:43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in thefield of Zoan.
78:44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, thatthey could not drink.
78:45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;and frogs, which destroyed them.
78:46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and theirlabour unto the locust.
78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore treeswith frost.
78:48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks tohot thunderbolts.
78:49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, andindignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
78:50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death,but gave their life over to the pestilence;
78:51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of theirstrength in the tabernacles of Ham:
78:52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided themin the wilderness like a flock.
78:53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the seaoverwhelmed their enemies.
78:54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to thismountain, which his right hand had purchased.
78:55 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them aninheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in theirtents.
78:56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept nothis testimonies:
78:57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: theywere turned aside like a deceitful bow.
78:58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and movedhim to jealousy with their graven images.
78:59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
78:60 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which heplaced among men;
78:61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory intothe enemy's hand.
78:62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth withhis inheritance.
78:63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were notgiven to marriage.
78:64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made nolamentation.
78:65 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty manthat shouteth by reason of wine.
78:66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to aperpetual reproach.
78:67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not thetribe of Ephraim:
78:68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
78:69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earthwhich he hath established for ever.
78:70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from thesheepfolds:
78:71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feedJacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
78:72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; andguided them by the skilfulness of his hands.
79:1 O God, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holytemple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.
79:2 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat untothe fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the beasts ofthe earth.
79:3 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; andthere was none to bury them.
79:4 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and derisionto them that are round about us.
79:5 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy jealousyburn like fire?
79:6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee, andupon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.
79:7 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling place.
79:8 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tendermercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.
79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name: anddeliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.
79:10 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him beknown among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of the blood ofthy servants which is shed.
79:11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according tothe greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed todie;
79:12 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom theirreproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.
79:13 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee thanksfor ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all generations.
80:1 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like aflock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine forth.
80:2 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,and come and save us.
80:3 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we shallbe saved.
80:4 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against theprayer of thy people?
80:5 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them tearsto drink in great measure.
80:6 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemieslaugh among themselves.
80:7 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine; andwe shall be saved.
80:8 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out theheathen, and planted it.
80:9 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take deeproot, and it filled the land.
80:10 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughsthereof were like the goodly cedars.
80:11 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto theriver.
80:12 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all theywhich pass by the way do pluck her?
80:13 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast ofthe field doth devour it.
80:14 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from heaven,and behold, and visit this vine;
80:15 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and thebranch that thou madest strong for thyself.
80:16 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at therebuke of thy countenance.
80:17 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son ofman whom thou madest strong for thyself.
80:18 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will callupon thy name.
80:19 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine; andwe shall be saved.
81:1 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto theGod of Jacob.
81:2 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harpwith the psaltery.
81:3 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, onour solemn feast day.
81:4 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
81:5 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went outthrough the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I understoodnot.
81:6 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were deliveredfrom the pots.
81:7 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered theein the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the waters ofMeribah.Selah.
81:8 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, ifthou wilt hearken unto me;
81:9 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worshipany strange god.
81:10 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land ofEgypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.
81:11 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel wouldnone of me.
81:12 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walkedin their own counsels.
81:13 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walkedin my ways!
81:14 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my handagainst their adversaries.
81:15 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves untohim: but their time should have endured for ever.
81:16 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: andwith honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.
82:1 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth amongthe gods.
82:2 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of thewicked? Selah.
82:3 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted andneedy.
82:4 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of thewicked.
82:5 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on indarkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.
82:6 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the mostHigh.
82:7 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.
82:8 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit allnations.
83:1 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be notstill, O God.
83:2 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate theehave lifted up the head.
83:3 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and consultedagainst thy hidden ones.
83:4 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being anation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.
83:5 For they have consulted together with one consent: they areconfederate against thee:
83:6 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and theHagarenes;
83:7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with theinhabitants of Tyre;
83:8 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children ofLot.Selah.
83:9 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to Jabin,at the brook of Kison:
83:10 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.
83:11 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all theirprinces as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:
83:12 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God inpossession.
83:13 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before thewind.
83:14 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth themountains on fire;
83:15 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid withthy storm.
83:16 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, OLORD.
83:17 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them beput to shame, and perish:
83:18 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, artthe most high over all the earth.
84:1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!
84:2 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the LORD:my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.
84:3 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest forherself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O LORD ofhosts, my King, and my God.
84:4 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be stillpraising thee. Selah.
84:5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart arethe ways of them.
84:6 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the rainalso filleth the pools.
84:7 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zionappeareth before God.
84:8 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.Selah.
84:9 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thineanointed.
84:10 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had ratherbe a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell in the tents ofwickedness.
84:11 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give graceand glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walkuprightly.
84:12 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.
85:1 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast broughtback the captivity of Jacob.
85:2 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast coveredall their sin. Selah.
85:3 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself fromthe fierceness of thine anger.
85:4 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward usto cease.
85:5 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thineanger to all generations?
85:6 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice inthee?
85:7 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.
85:8 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak peaceunto his people, and to his saints: but let them not turn again tofolly.
85:9 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory maydwell in our land.
85:10 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace havekissed each other.
85:11 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shalllook down from heaven.
85:12 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land shallyield her increase.
85:13 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the wayof his steps.
86:1 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.
86:2 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy servantthat trusteth in thee.
86:3 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.
86:4 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I liftup my soul.
86:5 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous inmercy unto all them that call upon thee.
86:6 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of mysupplications.
86:7 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wiltanswer me.
86:8 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither arethere any works like unto thy works.
86:9 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship beforethee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.
86:10 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art Godalone.
86:11 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite myheart to fear thy name.
86:12 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I willglorify thy name for evermore.
86:13 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered mysoul from the lowest hell.
86:14 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies ofviolent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee beforethem.
86:15 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,long suffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.
86:16 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength untothy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.
86:17 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and comforted me.
87:1 His foundation is in the holy mountains.
87:2 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings ofJacob.
87:3 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.
87:4 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born there.
87:5 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her:and the highest himself shall establish her.
87:6 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that thisman was born there. Selah.
87:7 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be there:all my springs are in thee.
88:1 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night beforethee:
88:2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
88:3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh untothe grave.
88:4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a manthat hath no strength:
88:5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whomthou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.
88:6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.
88:7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with allthy waves. Selah.
88:8 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast mademe an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot come forth.
88:9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have calleddaily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
88:10 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise andpraise thee? Selah.
88:11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thyfaithfulness in destruction?
88:12 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness inthe land of forgetfulness?
88:13 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall myprayer prevent thee.
88:14 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy facefrom me?
88:15 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I sufferthy terrors I am distracted.
88:16 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.
88:17 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed meabout together.
88:18 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mineacquaintance into darkness.
89:1 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouthwill I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.
89:2 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thyfaithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.
89:3 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David myservant,
89:4 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne toall generations. Selah.
89:5 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thyfaithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.
89:6 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who amongthe sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?
89:7 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and tobe had in reverence of all them that are about him.
89:8 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or tothy faithfulness round about thee?
89:9 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof arise,thou stillest them.
89:10 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thouhast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.
89:11 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the worldand the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.
89:12 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermonshall rejoice in thy name.
89:13 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thyright hand.
89:14 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy andtruth shall go before thy face.
89:15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shallwalk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.
89:16 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thyrighteousness shall they be exalted.
89:17 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour ourhorn shall be exalted.
89:18 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is ourking.
89:19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I havelaid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one chosen out ofthe people.
89:20 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointedhim:
89:21 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shallstrengthen him.
89:22 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickednessafflict him.
89:23 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague themthat hate him.
89:24 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in myname shall his horn be exalted.
89:25 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in therivers.
89:26 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rockof my salvation.
89:27 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of theearth.
89:28 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shallstand fast with him.
89:29 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne asthe days of heaven.
89:30 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;
89:31 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;
89:32 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and theiriniquity with stripes.
89:33 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from him,nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.
89:34 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is goneout of my lips.
89:35 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto David.
89:36 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun beforeme.
89:37 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a faithfulwitness in heaven. Selah.
89:38 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth withthine anointed.
89:39 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hastprofaned his crown by casting it to the ground.
89:40 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought hisstrong holds to ruin.
89:41 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to hisneighbours.
89:42 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hastmade all his enemies to rejoice.
89:43 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not madehim to stand in the battle.
89:44 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down tothe ground.
89:45 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered himwith shame. Selah.
89:46 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy wrathburn like fire?
89:47 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all menin vain?
89:48 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall hedeliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.
89:49 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou swarestunto David in thy truth?
89:50 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear inmy bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;
89:51 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith theyhave reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.
89:52 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.
90:1 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
90:2 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadstformed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting,thou art God.
90:3 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye childrenof men.
90:4 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it ispast, and as a watch in the night.
90:5 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep: inthe morning they are like grass which groweth up.
90:6 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening itis cut down, and withereth.
90:7 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are wetroubled.
90:8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in thelight of thy countenance.
90:9 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our yearsas a tale that is told.
90:10 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if byreason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strengthlabour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
90:11 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thyfear, so is thy wrath.
90:12 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our heartsunto wisdom.
90:13 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning thyservants.
90:14 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and beglad all our days.
90:15 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflictedus, and the years wherein we have seen evil.
90:16 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto theirchildren.
90:17 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and establishthou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our handsestablish thou it.
91:1 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall abideunder the shadow of the Almighty.
91:2 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my God;in him will I trust.
91:3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, andfrom the noisome pestilence.
91:4 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings shaltthou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.
91:5 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for thearrow that flieth by day;
91:6 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for thedestruction that wasteth at noonday.
91:7 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy righthand; but it shall not come nigh thee.
91:8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of thewicked.
91:9 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even themost High, thy habitation;
91:10 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague comenigh thy dwelling.
91:11 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee inall thy ways.
91:12 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy footagainst a stone.
91:13 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and thedragon shalt thou trample under feet.
91:14 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliverhim: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.
91:15 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with himin trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.
91:16 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.
92:1 It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to singpraises unto thy name, O most High:
92:2 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thyfaithfulness every night,
92:3 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; uponthe harp with a solemn sound.
92:4 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I willtriumph in the works of thy hands.
92:5 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very deep.
92:6 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand this.
92:7 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers ofiniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed for ever:
92:8 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.
92:9 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shallperish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.
92:10 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: Ishall be anointed with fresh oil.
92:11 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine earsshall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against me.
92:12 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall growlike a cedar in Lebanon.
92:13 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish inthe courts of our God.
92:14 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be fatand flourishing;
92:15 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is nounrighteousness in him.
93:1 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD isclothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the worldalso is stablished, that it cannot be moved.
93:2 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.
93:3 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted uptheir voice; the floods lift up their waves.
93:4 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters, yea,than the mighty waves of the sea.
93:5 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house, OLORD, for ever.
94:1 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom vengeancebelongeth, shew thyself.
94:2 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to theproud.
94:3 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wickedtriumph?
94:4 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all theworkers of iniquity boast themselves?
94:5 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thineheritage.
94:6 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless.
94:7 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God ofJacob regard it.
94:8 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when willye be wise?
94:9 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed theeye, shall he not see?
94:10 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he thatteacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?
94:11 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.
94:12 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachesthim out of thy law;
94:13 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity, untilthe pit be digged for the wicked.
94:14 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will heforsake his inheritance.
94:15 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all theupright in heart shall follow it.
94:16 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will standup for me against the workers of iniquity?
94:17 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt insilence.
94:18 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.
94:19 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delightmy soul.
94:20 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, whichframeth mischief by a law?
94:21 They gather themselves together against the soul of therighteous, and condemn the innocent blood.
94:22 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my refuge.
94:23 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cutthem off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall cut themoff.
95:1 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise tothe rock of our salvation.
95:2 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make ajoyful noise unto him with psalms.
95:3 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.
95:4 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of thehills is his also.
95:5 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dryland.
95:6 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the LORDour maker.
95:7 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and thesheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,
95:8 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the dayof temptation in the wilderness:
95:9 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.
95:10 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not known myways:
95:11 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into myrest.
96:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all theearth.
96:2 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation fromday to day.
96:3 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among allpeople.
96:4 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to befeared above all gods.
96:5 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made theheavens.
96:6 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in hissanctuary.
96:7 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto theLORD glory and strength.
96:8 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring anoffering, and come into his courts.
96:9 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,all the earth.
96:10 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world alsoshall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall judge thepeople righteously.
96:11 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the searoar, and the fulness thereof.
96:12 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall allthe trees of the wood rejoice
96:13 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge theearth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoplewith his truth.
97:1 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude ofisles be glad thereof.
97:2 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness andjudgment are the habitation of his throne.
97:3 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about.
97:4 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, andtrembled.
97:5 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at thepresence of the Lord of the whole earth.
97:6 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see hisglory.
97:7 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boastthemselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.
97:8 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoicedbecause of thy judgments, O LORD.
97:9 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exaltedfar above all gods.
97:10 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of hissaints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.
97:11 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright inheart.
97:12 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at theremembrance of his holiness.
98:1 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellousthings: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.
98:2 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath heopenly shewed in the sight of the heathen.
98:3 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house ofIsrael: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God.
98:4 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loudnoise, and rejoice, and sing praise.
98:5 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice ofa psalm.
98:6 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before theLORD, the King.
98:7 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and theythat dwell therein.
98:8 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful together
98:9 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: withrighteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity.
99:1 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between thecherubims; let the earth be moved.
99:2 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the people.
99:3 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.
99:4 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establishequity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.
99:5 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for heis holy.
99:6 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them thatcall upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered them.
99:7 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept histestimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.
99:8 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God thatforgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their inventions.
99:9 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for theLORD our God is holy.
100:1 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.
100:2 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence withsinging.
100:3 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us, andnot we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.
100:4 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts withpraise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.
100:5 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truthendureth to all generations.
101:1 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will Ising.
101:2 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thoucome unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
101:3 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work ofthem that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.
101:4 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wickedperson.
101:5 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off: himthat hath an high look and a proud heart will not I suffer.
101:6 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they maydwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.
101:7 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he thattelleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.
101:8 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cutoff all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
102:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.
102:2 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me speedily.
102:3 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned asan hearth.
102:4 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forgetto eat my bread.
102:5 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to myskin.
102:6 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of thedesert.
102:7 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.
102:8 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are madagainst me are sworn against me.
102:9 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink withweeping.
102:10 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hastlifted me up, and cast me down.
102:11 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am witheredlike grass.
102:12 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembranceunto all generations.
102:13 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time tofavour her, yea, the set time, is come.
102:14 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour thedust thereof.
102:15 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all thekings of the earth thy glory.
102:16 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in hisglory.
102:17 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despisetheir prayer.
102:18 This shall be written for the generation to come: and thepeople which shall be created shall praise the LORD.
102:19 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; fromheaven did the LORD behold the earth;
102:20 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that areappointed to death;
102:21 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise inJerusalem;
102:22 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, toserve the LORD.
102:23 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.
102:24 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days: thyyears are throughout all generations.
102:25 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and theheavens are the work of thy hands.
102:26 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of themshall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, andthey shall be changed:
102:27 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.
102:28 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seedshall be established before thee.
103:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless hisholy name.
103:2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
103:3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thydiseases;
103:4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee withlovingkindness and tender mercies;
103:5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth isrenewed like the eagle's.
103:6 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that areoppressed.
103:7 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children ofIsrael.
103:8 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteousin mercy.
103:9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger forever.
103:10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded usaccording to our iniquities.
103:11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is hismercy toward them that fear him.
103:12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed ourtransgressions from us.
103:13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth themthat fear him.
103:14 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.
103:15 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, sohe flourisheth.
103:16 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the placethereof shall know it no more.
103:17 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlastingupon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children'schildren;
103:18 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember hiscommandments to do them.
103:19 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and hiskingdom ruleth over all.
103:20 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that dohis commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.
103:21 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, thatdo his pleasure.
103:22 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:bless the LORD, O my soul.
104:1 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;thou art clothed with honour and majesty.
104:2 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: whostretchest out the heavens like a curtain:
104:3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who makeththe clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
104:4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
104:5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not beremoved for ever.
104:6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the watersstood above the mountains.
104:7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hastedaway.
104:8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys untothe place which thou hast founded for them.
104:9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that theyturn not again to cover the earth.
104:10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among thehills.
104:11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild assesquench their thirst.
104:12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,which sing among the branches.
104:13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfiedwith the fruit of thy works.
104:14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for theservice of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
104:15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make hisface to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.
104:16 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,which he hath planted;
104:17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the firtrees are her house.
104:18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocksfor the conies.
104:19 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his goingdown.
104:20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beastsof the forest do creep forth.
104:21 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat fromGod.
104:22 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay themdown in their dens.
104:23 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until theevening.
104:24 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou madethem all: the earth is full of thy riches.
104:25 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creepinginnumerable, both small and great beasts.
104:26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hastmade to play therein.
104:27 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their meatin due season.
104:28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,they are filled with good.
104:29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away theirbreath, they die, and return to their dust.
104:30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thourenewest the face of the earth.
104:31 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shallrejoice in his works.
104:32 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth thehills, and they smoke.
104:33 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing praiseto my God while I have my being.
104:34 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in theLORD.
104:35 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let thewicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye the LORD.
105:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known hisdeeds among the people.
105:2 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his wondrousworks.
105:3 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice thatseek the LORD.
105:4 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.
105:5 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,and the judgments of his mouth;
105:6 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob hischosen.
105:7 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
105:8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which hecommanded to a thousand generations.
105:9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
105:10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel foran everlasting covenant:
105:11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot ofyour inheritance:
105:12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, andstrangers in it.
105:13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom toanother people;
105:14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings fortheir sakes;
105:15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
105:16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake thewhole staff of bread.
105:17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for aservant:
105:18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
105:19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD triedhim.
105:20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people, andlet him go free.
105:21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
105:22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senatorswisdom.
105:23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land ofHam.
105:24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them strongerthan their enemies.
105:25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly withhis servants.
105:26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
105:27 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land ofHam.
105:28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled notagainst his word.
105:29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
105:30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers oftheir kings.
105:31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in alltheir coasts.
105:32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
105:33 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake thetrees of their coasts.
105:34 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and thatwithout number,
105:35 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured thefruit of their ground.
105:36 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of alltheir strength.
105:37 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there wasnot one feeble person among their tribes.
105:38 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fellupon them.
105:39 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in thenight.
105:40 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied themwith the bread of heaven.
105:41 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in thedry places like a river.
105:42 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.
105:43 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen withgladness:
105:44 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited thelabour of the people;
105:45 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws. Praiseye the LORD.
106:1 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good:for his mercy endureth for ever.
106:2 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forthall his praise?
106:3 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doethrighteousness at all times.
106:4 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto thypeople: O visit me with thy salvation;
106:5 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in thegladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine inheritance.
106:6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, wehave done wickedly.
106:7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they rememberednot the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even atthe Red sea.
106:8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he mightmake his mighty power to be known.
106:9 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led themthrough the depths, as through the wilderness.
106:10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, andredeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
106:11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of themleft.
106:12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
106:13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
106:14 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God inthe desert.
106:15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into theirsoul.
106:16 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of theLORD.
106:17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered thecompany of Abiram.
106:18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned upthe wicked.
106:19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
106:20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox thateateth grass.
106:21 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things inEgypt;
106:22 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by theRed sea.
106:23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses hischosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest heshould destroy them.
106:24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not hisword:
106:25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voiceof the LORD.
106:26 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow themin the wilderness:
106:27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatterthem in the lands.
106:28 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate thesacrifices of the dead.
106:29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and theplague brake in upon them.
106:30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so theplague was stayed.
106:31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto allgenerations for evermore.
106:32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it wentill with Moses for their sakes:
106:33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedlywith his lips.
106:34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORDcommanded them:
106:35 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.
106:36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
106:37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters untodevils,
106:38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and oftheir daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: andthe land was polluted with blood.
106:39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoringwith their own inventions.
106:40 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his people,insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.
106:41 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they thathated them ruled over them.
106:42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought intosubjection under their hand.
106:43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him withtheir counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
106:44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard theircry:
106:45 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented accordingto the multitude of his mercies.
106:46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried themcaptives.
106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise.
106:48 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting toeverlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the LORD.
107:1 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercyendureth for ever.
107:2 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed fromthe hand of the enemy;
107:3 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from thewest, from the north, and from the south.
107:4 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found nocity to dwell in.
107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.
107:6 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he deliveredthem out of their distresses.
107:7 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to acity of habitation.
107:8 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for hiswonderful works to the children of men!
107:9 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry soulwith goodness.
107:10 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being boundin affliction and iron;
107:11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemnedthe counsel of the most High:
107:12 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they felldown, and there was none to help.
107:13 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he savedthem out of their distresses.
107:14 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, andbrake their bands in sunder.
107:15 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for hiswonderful works to the children of men!
107:16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of ironin sunder.
107:17 Fools because of their transgression, and because of theiriniquities, are afflicted.
107:18 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw nearunto the gates of death.
107:19 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveththem out of their distresses.
107:20 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them fromtheir destructions.
107:21 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for hiswonderful works to the children of men!
107:22 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, anddeclare his works with rejoicing.
107:23 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business ingreat waters;
107:24 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.
107:25 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which liftethup the waves thereof.
107:26 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:their soul is melted because of trouble.
107:27 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and areat their wit's end.
107:28 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeththem out of their distresses.
107:29 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof arestill.
107:30 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth themunto their desired haven.
107:31 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for hiswonderful works to the children of men!
107:32 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, andpraise him in the assembly of the elders.
107:33 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings intodry ground;
107:34 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of themthat dwell therein.
107:35 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry groundinto watersprings.
107:36 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may preparea city for habitation;
107:37 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield fruitsof increase.
107:38 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly; andsuffereth not their cattle to decrease.
107:39 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,affliction, and sorrow.
107:40 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander inthe wilderness, where there is no way.
107:41 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh himfamilies like a flock.
107:42 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity shallstop her mouth.
107:43 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shallunderstand the lovingkindness of the LORD.
108:1 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even withmy glory.
108:2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.
108:3 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will singpraises unto thee among the nations.
108:4 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth reachethunto the clouds.
108:5 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory aboveall the earth;
108:6 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand, andanswer me.
108:7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divideShechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.
108:8 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strengthof mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;
108:9 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; overPhilistia will I triumph.
108:10 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me intoEdom?
108:11 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,O God, go forth with our hosts?
108:12 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
108:13 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shalltread down our enemies.
109:1 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
109:2 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful areopened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying tongue.
109:3 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and foughtagainst me without a cause.
109:4 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself untoprayer.
109:5 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
109:6 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his righthand.
109:7 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let hisprayer become sin.
109:8 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
109:9 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
109:10 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let themseek their bread also out of their desolate places.
109:11 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let thestrangers spoil his labour.
109:12 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let therebe any to favour his fatherless children.
109:13 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation followinglet their name be blotted out.
109:14 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
109:15 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut offthe memory of them from the earth.
109:16 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecutedthe poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
109:17 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delightednot in blessing, so let it be far from him.
109:18 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, solet it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
109:19 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for agirdle wherewith he is girded continually.
109:20 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, andof them that speak evil against my soul.
109:21 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.
109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
109:23 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up anddown as the locust.
109:24 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth offatness.
109:25 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon methey shaked their heads.
109:26 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:
109:27 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hastdone it.
109:28 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them beashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.
109:29 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them coverthemselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
109:30 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I willpraise him among the multitude.
109:31 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save himfrom those that condemn his soul.
110:1 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until Imake thine enemies thy footstool.
110:2 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rulethou in the midst of thine enemies.
110:3 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in thebeauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast the dewof thy youth.
110:4 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
110:5 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the dayof his wrath.
110:6 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places withthe dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many countries.
110:7 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he liftup the head.
111:1 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole heart,in the assembly of the upright, and in the congregation.
111:2 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them thathave pleasure therein.
111:3 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousnessendureth for ever.
111:4 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD isgracious and full of compassion.
111:5 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever bemindful of his covenant.
111:6 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he maygive them the heritage of the heathen.
111:7 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all hiscommandments are sure.
111:8 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth anduprightness.
111:9 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded hiscovenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.
111:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a goodunderstanding have all they that do his commandments: his praiseendureth for ever.
112:1 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
112:2 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of theupright shall be blessed.
112:3 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousnessendureth for ever.
112:4 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he isgracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.
112:5 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide hisaffairs with discretion.
112:6 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be ineverlasting remembrance.
112:7 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,trusting in the LORD.
112:8 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he seehis desire upon his enemies.
112:9 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousnessendureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
112:10 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash withhis teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall perish.
113:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praisethe name of the LORD.
113:2 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.
113:3 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same theLORD's name is to be praised.
113:4 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above theheavens.
113:5 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,
113:6 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,and in the earth!
113:7 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needyout of the dunghill;
113:8 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of hispeople.
113:9 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyfulmother of children. Praise ye the LORD.
114:1 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a peopleof strange language;
114:2 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.
114:3 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.
114:4 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills likelambs.
114:5 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,that thou wast driven back?
114:6 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,like lambs?
114:7 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at thepresence of the God of Jacob;
114:8 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into afountain of waters.
115:1 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory,for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
115:2 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
115:3 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hathpleased.
115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
115:5 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but theysee not:
115:6 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but theysmell not:
115:7 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but theywalk not: neither speak they through their throat.
115:8 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one thattrusteth in them.
115:9 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and theirshield.
115:10 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and theirshield.
115:11 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help andtheir shield.
115:12 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he willbless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.
115:13 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
115:14 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and yourchildren.
115:15 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
115:16 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earthhath he given to the children of men.
115:17 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down intosilence.
115:18 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and forevermore.Praise the LORD.
116:1 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and mysupplications.
116:2 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I callupon him as long as I live.
116:3 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gathold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.
116:4 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech thee,deliver my soul.
116:5 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.
116:6 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he helpedme.
116:7 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealtbountifully with thee.
116:8 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes fromtears, and my feet from falling.
116:9 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.
116:10 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:
116:11 I said in my haste, All men are liars.
116:12 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits towardme?
116:13 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of theLORD.
116:14 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all hispeople.
116:15 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.
116:16 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the sonof thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.
116:17 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and willcall upon the name of the LORD.
116:18 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all hispeople.
116:19 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, OJerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.
117:1 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.
117:2 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth ofthe LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.
118:1 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercyendureth for ever.
118:2 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth forever.
118:4 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth forever.
118:5 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, andset me in a large place.
118:6 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do untome?
118:7 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore shallI see my desire upon them that hate me.
118:8 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
118:9 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence inprinces.
118:10 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORDwill I destroy them.
118:11 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but inthe name of the LORD I will destroy them.
118:12 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as thefire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy them.
118:13 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORDhelped me.
118:14 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
118:15 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles ofthe righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.
118:16 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of theLORD doeth valiantly.
118:17 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
118:18 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me overunto death.
118:19 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them, andI will praise the LORD:
118:20 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
118:21 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become mysalvation.
118:22 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stoneof the corner.
118:23 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
118:24 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice andbe glad in it.
118:25 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, sendnow prosperity.
118:26 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we haveblessed you out of the house of the LORD.
118:27 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the sacrificewith cords, even unto the horns of the altar.
118:28 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, Iwill exalt thee.
118:29 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercyendureth for ever.
119:1 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of theLORD.
119:2 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek himwith the whole heart.
119:3 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

119:6 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thycommandments.
119:7 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall havelearned thy righteous judgments.
119:8 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.
119:9 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heedthereto according to thy word.
119:10 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wanderfrom thy commandments.
119:11 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin againstthee.
119:12 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.
119:13 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
119:14 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as inall riches.
119:15 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thyways.
119:16 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thyword.

119:20 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thyjudgments at all times.
119:21 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err fromthy commandments.
119:22 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thytestimonies.
119:23 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant didmeditate in thy statutes.
119:24 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
119:25 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according tothy word.

119:27 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talkof thy wondrous works.
119:28 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me accordingunto thy word.
119:29 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy lawgraciously.
119:30 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laidbefore me.
119:31 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to shame.
119:32 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlargemy heart.
119:33 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep itunto the end.
119:34 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shallobserve it with my whole heart.
119:35 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do Idelight.
119:36 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
119:37 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou mein thy way.

119:39 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are good.
119:40 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thyrighteousness.
119:41 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,according to thy word.
119:42 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:for I trust in thy word.
119:43 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for Ihave hoped in thy judgments.
119:44 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
119:45 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.
119:46 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will notbe ashamed.
119:47 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I haveloved.
119:48 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which Ihave loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
119:49 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast causedme to hope.
119:50 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hathquickened me.
119:51 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I notdeclined from thy law.
119:52 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comfortedmyself.
119:53 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked thatforsake thy law.
119:54 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
119:55 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have keptthy law.
119:56 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
119:57 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thywords.
119:58 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto meaccording to thy word.
119:59 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
119:60 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
119:61 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have notforgotten thy law.
119:62 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thyrighteous judgments.
119:63 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them thatkeep thy precepts.
119:64 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy statutes.
119:65 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according untothy word.
119:66 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thycommandments.
119:67 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thyword.
119:68 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
119:69 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thyprecepts with my whole heart.
119:70 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
119:71 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I mightlearn thy statutes.
119:72 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of goldand silver.
119:73 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me understanding,that I may learn thy commandments.
119:74 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because Ihave hoped in thy word.
119:75 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou infaithfulness hast afflicted me.
119:76 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,according to thy word unto thy servant.
119:77 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thylaw is my delight.
119:78 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with mewithout a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.
119:79 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that haveknown thy testimonies.
119:80 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
119:81 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.
119:82 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
119:83 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forgetthy statutes.
119:84 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou executejudgment on them that persecute me?
119:85 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
119:86 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute mewrongfully; help thou me.
119:87 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thyprecepts.
119:88 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep thetestimony of thy mouth.
119:89 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
119:90 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast establishedthe earth, and it abideth.
119:91 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for allare thy servants.
119:92 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then haveperished in mine affliction.
119:93 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hastquickened me.
119:94 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.
119:95 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I willconsider thy testimonies.
119:96 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment isexceeding broad.
119:97 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
119:98 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mineenemies: for they are ever with me.
119:99 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thytestimonies are my meditation.
119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thyprecepts.
119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I mightkeep thy word.
119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taughtme.
119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honeyto my mouth!
119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hateevery false way.
119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thyrighteous judgments.
119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according untothy word.
119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, OLORD, and teach me thy judgments.
119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thylaw.
119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thyprecepts.
119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for theyare the rejoicing of my heart.
119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, evenunto the end.
119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.
119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.
119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandmentsof my God.
119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let menot be ashamed of my hope.
119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respectunto thy statutes continually.
119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:for their deceit is falsehood.
119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:therefore I love thy testimonies.
119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thyjudgments.
119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mineoppressors.
119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppressme.
119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thyrighteousness.
119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach methy statutes.
119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thytestimonies.
119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made voidthy law.
119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above finegold.
119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things tobe right; and I hate every false way.
119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keepthem.
119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it givethunderstanding unto the simple.
119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thycommandments.
119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest todo unto those that love thy name.
119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity havedominion over me.
119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thyprecepts.
119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thystatutes.
119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thylaw.
119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.
119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous andvery faithful.
119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgottenthy words.
119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.
119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.
119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy lawis the truth.
119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thycommandments are my delights.
119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give meunderstanding, and I shall live.
119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thystatutes.
119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped inthy word.
119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate inthy word.
119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,quicken me according to thy judgment.
119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far fromthy law.
119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.
119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hastfounded them for ever.
119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forgetthy law.

119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not declinefrom thy testimonies.
119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they keptnot thy word.
119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,according to thy lovingkindness.
119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thyrighteous judgments endureth for ever.
119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heartstandeth in awe of thy word.
119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.
119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteousjudgments.

120:1 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.
120:2 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitfultongue.
120:3 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto thee,thou false tongue?
120:4 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.
120:5 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tentsof Kedar!
120:6 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.
120:7 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.
121:1 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh myhelp.
121:2 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.
121:3 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth theewill not slumber.
121:4 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.
121:5 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy righthand.
121:6 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.
121:7 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preservethy soul.
121:8 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in fromthis time forth, and even for evermore.
122:1 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house ofthe LORD.
122:2 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.
122:3 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:
122:4 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto thetestimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.
122:5 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the houseof David.
122:6 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that lovethee.
122:7 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.
122:8 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace bewithin thee.
122:9 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.
123:1 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in theheavens.
123:2 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of theirmasters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her mistress; soour eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that he have mercy upon us.
123:3 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we areexceedingly filled with contempt.
123:4 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those thatare at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.
124:1 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may Israelsay;
124:2 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men roseup against us:
124:3 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath waskindled against us:
124:4 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over oursoul:
124:5 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.
124:6 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to theirteeth.
124:7 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:the snare is broken, and we are escaped.
124:8 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and earth.
125:1 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which cannotbe removed, but abideth for ever.
125:2 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is roundabout his people from henceforth even for ever.
125:3 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of therighteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.
125:4 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that areupright in their hearts.
125:5 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORDshall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace shall beupon Israel.
126:1 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were likethem that dream.
126:2 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue withsinging: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done greatthings for them.
126:3 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.
126:4 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.
126:5 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.
126:6 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shalldoubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.
127:1 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that buildit: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
127:2 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat thebread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.
127:3 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of thewomb is his reward.
127:4 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children ofthe youth.
127:5 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shallnot be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate.
128:1 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in hisways.
128:2 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thoube, and it shall be well with thee.
128:3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thinehouse: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.
128:4 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth theLORD.
128:5 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see thegood of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.
128:6 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace uponIsrael.
129:1 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel nowsay:
129:2 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they havenot prevailed against me.
129:3 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.
129:4 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of thewicked.
129:5 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
129:6 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which witherethafore it groweth up:
129:7 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindethsheaves his bosom.
129:8 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD beupon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.
130:1 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.
130:2 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice ofmy supplications.
130:3 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shallstand?
130:4 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared.
130:5 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do Ihope.
130:6 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for themorning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.
130:7 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,and with him is plenteous redemption.
130:8 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.
131:1 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do Iexercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for me.
131:2 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that isweaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.
131:3 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.
132:1 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:
132:2 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God ofJacob;
132:3 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor goup into my bed;
132:4 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine eyelids,
132:5 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for themighty God of Jacob.
132:6 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of thewood.
132:7 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at hisfootstool.
132:8 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy strength.
132:9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thysaints shout for joy.
132:10 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thineanointed.
132:11 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn fromit; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.
132:12 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that Ishall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy throne forevermore.
132:13 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for hishabitation.
132:14 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desiredit.
132:15 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poorwith bread.
132:16 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saintsshall shout aloud for joy.
132:17 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained alamp for mine anointed.
132:18 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shallhis crown flourish.
133:1 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwelltogether in unity!
133:2 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran downupon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the skirts ofhis garments;
133:3 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon themountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing, evenlife for evermore.
134:1 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which bynight stand in the house of the LORD.
134:2 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.
134:3 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.
135:1 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise him,O ye servants of the LORD.
135:2 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of thehouse of our God.
135:3 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto hisname; for it is pleasant.
135:4 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for hispeculiar treasure.
135:5 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is aboveall gods.
135:6 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and inearth, in the seas, and all deep places.

137:1 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept, whenwe remembered Zion.
137:2 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.
137:3 For there they that carried us away captive required of us asong; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying, Sing usone of the songs of Zion.
137:4 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?
137:5 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget hercunning.
137:6 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof ofmy mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.
137:7 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem;who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation thereof.
137:8 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall hebe, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.
137:9 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little onesagainst the stones.
138:1 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will Ising praise unto thee.
138:2 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name forthy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified thy wordabove all thy name.
138:3 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedstme with strength in my soul.
138:4 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when theyhear the words of thy mouth.
138:5 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is theglory of the LORD.
138:6 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly: butthe proud he knoweth afar off.

139:1 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.
139:2 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thouunderstandest my thought afar off.
139:3 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquaintedwith all my ways.
139:4 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thouknowest it altogether.
139:5 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand uponme.
139:6 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannotattain unto it.
139:7 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee fromthy presence?
139:8 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed inhell, behold, thou art there.
139:9 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermostparts of the sea;
139:10 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shallhold me.
139:11 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the nightshall be light about me.
139:12 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shinethas the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.
139:13 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in mymother's womb.
139:14 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.
139:15 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.
139:16 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and inthy book all my members were written, which in continuance werefashioned, when as yet there was none of them.
139:17 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great isthe sum of them!
139:18 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:when I awake, I am still with thee.
139:19 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from metherefore, ye bloody men.
139:20 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies takethy name in vain.
139:21 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not Igrieved with those that rise up against thee?
139:22 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.
139:23 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know mythoughts:
139:24 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in theway everlasting.
140:1 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from theviolent man;
140:2 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are theygathered together for war.
140:3 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders' poisonis under their lips. Selah.
140:4 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me fromthe violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my goings.
140:5 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread anet by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.
140:6 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of mysupplications, O LORD.
140:7 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast coveredmy head in the day of battle.
140:8 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not hiswicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.
140:9 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the mischiefof their own lips cover them.
140:10 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into thefire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.
140:11 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil shallhunt the violent man to overthrow him.
140:12 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,and the right of the poor.
140:13 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: theupright shall dwell in thy presence.
141:1 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto myvoice, when I cry unto thee.
141:2 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and thelifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.
141:3 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my lips.
141:4 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked workswith men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their dainties.
141:5 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let himreprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break myhead: for yet my prayer also shall be in their calamities.
141:6 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shallhear my words; for they are sweet.
141:7 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when onecutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.
141:8 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is mytrust; leave not my soul destitute.
141:9 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and thegins of the workers of iniquity.
141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withalescape.
142:1 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the LORDdid I make my supplication.
142:2 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him mytrouble.
142:3 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest mypath.In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
142:4 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man thatwould know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
142:5 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and myportion in the land of the living.
142:6 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me frommy persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
142:7 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: therighteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal bountifully withme.
143:1 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thyfaithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.
143:2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sightshall no man living be justified.
143:3 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my lifedown to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as thosethat have been long dead.
143:4 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within meis desolate.
143:5 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I museon the work of thy hands.
143:6 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth afterthee, as a thirsty land. Selah.
143:7 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy facefrom me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.
143:8 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in theedo I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should walk; for I liftup my soul unto thee.
143:9 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to hideme.
143:10 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit isgood; lead me into the land of uprightness.
143:11 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy righteousness'sake bring my soul out of trouble.
143:12 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all themthat afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.
144:1 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to war,and my fingers to fight:
144:2 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
144:3 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the sonof man, that thou makest account of him!
144:4 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passethaway.
144:5 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains, andthey shall smoke.
144:6 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine arrows,and destroy them.
144:7 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of greatwaters, from the hand of strange children;
144:8 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a righthand of falsehood.
144:9 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and aninstrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.
144:10 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth Davidhis servant from the hurtful sword.
144:11 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whosemouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand offalsehood:
144:12 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; thatour daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitudeof a palace:
144:13 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in ourstreets:
144:14 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be nobreaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in ourstreets.
144:15 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy isthat people, whose God is the LORD.

145:14 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those thatbe bowed down.
145:15 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their meatin due season.
145:16 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of everyliving thing.
145:17 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all hisworks.
145:18 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all thatcall upon him in truth.
145:19 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also willhear their cry, and will save them.
145:20 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wickedwill he destroy.

146:2 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto myGod while I have any being.
146:3 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whomthere is no help.
146:4 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that veryday his thoughts perish.
146:5 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hopeis in the LORD his God:
146:6 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is:which keepeth truth for ever:
146:7 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food tothe hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:
