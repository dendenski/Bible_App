1:1 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love inthe truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known thetruth; 
1:2 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall bewith us for ever.
1:3 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and fromthe Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
1:4 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in truth,as we have received a commandment from the Father.
1:5 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a newcommandment unto thee, but that which we had from the beginning, thatwe love one another.
1:6 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is thecommandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye should walkin it.
1:7 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess notthat Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and anantichrist.
1:8 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we havewrought, but that we receive a full reward.
1:9 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine ofChrist, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of Christ, hehath both the Father and the Son.
1:10 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine, receivehim not into your house, neither bid him God speed: 
1:11 For he thatbiddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil deeds.
1:12 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write withpaper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to face,that our joy may be full.
1:13 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.
