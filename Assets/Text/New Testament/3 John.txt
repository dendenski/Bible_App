1:1 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth.
1:2 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and bein health, even as thy soul prospereth.
1:3 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified ofthe truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the truth.
1:4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth.
1:5 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to thebrethren, and to strangers; 
1:6 Which have borne witness of thycharity before the church: whom if thou bring forward on their journeyafter a godly sort, thou shalt do well: 
1:7 Because that for hisname's sake they went forth, taking nothing of the Gentiles.
1:8 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be fellowhelpersto the truth.
1:9 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have thepreeminence among them, receiveth us not.
1:10 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doeth,prating against us with malicious words: and not content therewith,neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them thatwould, and casteth them out of the church.
1:11 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is good.He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil hath not seenGod.
1:12 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth itself:yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our record is true.
1:13 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen writeunto thee: 
1:14 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shallspeak face to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greetthe friends by name.
