1:1 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel; 
1:2 Toknow wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
1:3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment, andequity; 
1:4 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledgeand discretion.
1:5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man ofunderstanding shall attain unto wise counsels: 
1:6 To understand aproverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their darksayings.
1:7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but foolsdespise wisdom and instruction.
1:8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not thelaw of thy mother: 
1:9 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thyhead, and chains about thy neck.
1:10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
1:11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurkprivily for the innocent without cause: 
1:12 Let us swallow them upalive as the grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
1:13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houseswith spoil: 
1:14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
1:15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot fromtheir path: 
1:16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shedblood.
1:17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
1:18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily fortheir own lives.
1:19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which takethaway the life of the owners thereof.
1:20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
1:21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings ofthe gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying, 
1:22 How long,ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight intheir scorning, and fools hate knowledge?  
1:23 Turn you at myreproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make knownmy words unto you.
1:24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out myhand, and no man regarded; 
1:25 But ye have set at nought all mycounsel, and would none of my reproof: 
1:26 I also will laugh at yourcalamity; I will mock when your fear cometh; 
1:27 When your fearcometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; whendistress and anguish cometh upon you.
1:28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shallseek me early, but they shall not find me: 
1:29 For that they hatedknowledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD: 
1:30 They wouldnone of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
1:31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and befilled with their own devices.
1:32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and theprosperity of fools shall destroy them.
1:33 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall bequiet from fear of evil.
2:1 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandmentswith thee; 
2:2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and applythine heart to understanding; 
2:3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge,and liftest up thy voice for understanding; 
2:4 If thou seekest her assilver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures; 
2:5 Then shaltthou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the knowledge of God.
2:6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge andunderstanding.
2:7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler tothem that walk uprightly.
2:8 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of hissaints.
2:9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, andequity; yea, every good path.
2:10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is pleasantunto thy soul; 
2:11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understandingshall keep thee: 
2:12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man,from the man that speaketh froward things; 
2:13 Who leave the paths ofuprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness; 
2:14 Who rejoice to doevil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked; 
2:15 Whose waysare crooked, and they froward in their paths: 
2:16 To deliver theefrom the strange woman, even from the stranger which flattereth withher words; 
2:17 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteththe covenant of her God.
2:18 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
2:19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of thepaths of life.
2:20 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the pathsof the righteous.
2:21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shallremain in it.
2:22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and thetransgressors shall be rooted out of it.
3:1 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep mycommandments: 
3:2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shallthey add to thee.
3:3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck;write them upon the table of thine heart: 
3:4 So shalt thou findfavour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
3:5 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto thineown understanding.
3:6 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
3:7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart fromevil.
3:8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
3:9 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits ofall thine increase: 
3:10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, andthy presses shall burst out with new wine.
3:11 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be wearyof his correction: 
3:12 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; evenas a father the son in whom he delighteth.
3:13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that gettethunderstanding.
3:14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise ofsilver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
3:15 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou canstdesire are not to be compared unto her.
3:16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand richesand honour.
3:17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
3:18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happyis every one that retaineth her.
3:19 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hathhe established the heavens.
3:20 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds dropdown the dew.
3:21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdomand discretion: 
3:22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace tothy neck.
3:23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall notstumble.
3:24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shaltlie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
3:25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of thewicked, when it cometh.
3:26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy footfrom being taken.
3:27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in thepower of thine hand to do it.
3:28 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow Iwill give; when thou hast it by thee.
3:29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwellethsecurely by thee.
3:30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee noharm.
3:31 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.
3:32 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret iswith the righteous.
3:33 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but heblesseth the habitation of the just.
3:34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto thelowly.
3:35 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion offools.
4:1 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to knowunderstanding.
4:2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.
4:3 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the sight ofmy mother.
4:4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain mywords: keep my commandments, and live.
4:5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline fromthe words of my mouth.
4:6 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and sheshall keep thee.
4:7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with allthy getting get understanding.
4:8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee tohonour, when thou dost embrace her.
4:9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown ofglory shall she deliver to thee.
4:10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy lifeshall be many.
4:11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in rightpaths.
4:12 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thourunnest, thou shalt not stumble.
4:13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for sheis thy life.
4:14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way ofevil men.
4:15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
4:16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and theirsleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine ofviolence.
4:18 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shinethmore and more unto the perfect day.
4:19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what theystumble.
4:20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
4:21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst ofthine heart.
4:22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to alltheir flesh.
4:23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issuesof life.
4:24 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put farfrom thee.
4:25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straightbefore thee.
4:26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
4:27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot fromevil.
5:1 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to myunderstanding: 
5:2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thylips may keep knowledge.
5:3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and hermouth is smoother than oil: 
5:4 But her end is bitter as wormwood,sharp as a two-edged sword.
5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.
5:6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways aremoveable, that thou canst not know them.
5:7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from thewords of my mouth.
5:8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of herhouse: 
5:9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years untothe cruel: 
5:10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thylabours be in the house of a stranger; 
5:11 And thou mourn at thelast, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed, 
5:12 And say, How haveI hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof; 
5:13 And have notobeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them thatinstructed me!  
5:14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of thecongregation and assembly.
5:15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out ofthine own well.
5:16 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters inthe streets.
5:17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
5:18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thyyouth.
5:19 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breastssatisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.
5:20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, andembrace the bosom of a stranger?  
5:21 For the ways of man are beforethe eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
5:22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall beholden with the cords of his sins.
5:23 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of hisfolly he shall go astray.
6:1 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast strickenthy hand with a stranger, 
6:2 Thou art snared with the words of thymouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
6:3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come intothe hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
6:4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.
6:5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as abird from the hand of the fowler.
6:6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise: 
6:7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler, 
6:8 Provideth her meat inthe summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
6:9 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out ofthy sleep?  
6:10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a littlefolding of the hands to sleep: 
6:11 So shall thy poverty come as onethat travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
6:12 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.
6:13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teachethwith his fingers; 
6:14 Frowardness is in his heart, he devisethmischief continually; he soweth discord.
6:15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he bebroken without remedy.
6:16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are anabomination unto him: 
6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and handsthat shed innocent blood, 
6:18 An heart that deviseth wickedimaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, 
6:19 A falsewitness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
6:20 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law ofthy mother: 
6:21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie themabout thy neck.
6:22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shallkeep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
6:23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofsof instruction are the way of life: 
6:24 To keep thee from the evilwoman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
6:25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her takethee with her eyelids.
6:26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece ofbread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.
6:27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
6:28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?  
6:29 Sohe that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever toucheth her shallnot be innocent.
6:30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul whenhe is hungry; 
6:31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; heshall give all the substance of his house.
6:32 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding:he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
6:33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not bewiped away.
6:34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare inthe day of vengeance.
6:35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,though thou givest many gifts.
7:1 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
7:2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thineeye.
7:3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thineheart.
7:4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thykinswoman: 
7:5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, fromthe stranger which flattereth with her words.
7:6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement, 
7:7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, ayoung man void of understanding, 
7:8 Passing through the street nearher corner; and he went the way to her house, 
7:9 In the twilight, inthe evening, in the black and dark night: 
7:10 And, behold, there methim a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtil of heart.
7:11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house: 
7:12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at everycorner.)  
7:13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudentface said unto him, 
7:14 I have peace offerings with me; this day haveI payed my vows.
7:15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face,and I have found thee.
7:16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carvedworks, with fine linen of Egypt.
7:17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
7:18 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let ussolace ourselves with loves.
7:19 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey: 
7:20 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the dayappointed.
7:21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with theflattering of her lips she forced him.
7:22 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter,or as a fool to the correction of the stocks; 
7:23 Till a dart strikethrough his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth notthat it is for his life.
7:24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to thewords of my mouth.
7:25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in herpaths.
7:26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men havebeen slain by her.
7:27 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers ofdeath.
8:1 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?  
8:2 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the places ofthe paths.
8:3 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the comingin at the doors.
8:4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.
8:5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of anunderstanding heart.
8:6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of mylips shall be right things.
8:7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abominationto my lips.
8:8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothingfroward or perverse in them.
8:9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to themthat find knowledge.
8:10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather thanchoice gold.
8:11 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may bedesired are not to be compared to it.
8:12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of wittyinventions.
8:13 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, andthe evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
8:14 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I havestrength.
8:15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
8:16 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth.
8:17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall findme.
8:18 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches andrighteousness.
8:19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenuethan choice silver.
8:20 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths ofjudgment: 
8:21 That I may cause those that love me to inheritsubstance; and I will fill their treasures.
8:22 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before hisworks of old.
8:23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever theearth was.
8:24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there wereno fountains abounding with water.
8:25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I broughtforth: 
8:26 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields,nor the highest part of the dust of the world.
8:27 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a compassupon the face of the depth: 
8:28 When he established the clouds above:when he strengthened the fountains of the deep: 
8:29 When he gave tothe sea his decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment:when he appointed the foundations of the earth: 
8:30 Then I was byhim, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight,rejoicing always before him; 
8:31 Rejoicing in the habitable part ofhis earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
8:32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed arethey that keep my ways.
8:33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
8:34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates,waiting at the posts of my doors.
8:35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of theLORD.
8:36 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all theythat hate me love death.
9:1 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her sevenpillars: 
9:2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine;she hath also furnished her table.
9:3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highestplaces of the city, 
9:4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: asfor him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
9:5 Come, eat ofmy bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
9:6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
9:7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he thatrebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.
9:8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, andhe will love thee.
9:9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach ajust man, and he will increase in learning.
9:10 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and theknowledge of the holy is understanding.
9:11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy lifeshall be increased.
9:12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thouscornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
9:13 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth nothing.
9:14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the highplaces of the city, 
9:15 To call passengers who go right on theirways: 
9:16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for himthat wanteth understanding, she saith to him, 
9:17 Stolen waters aresweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
9:18 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guestsare in the depths of hell.

10:11 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violencecovereth the mouth of the wicked.
10:12 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.
10:13 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found: buta rod is for the back of him that is void of understanding.
10:14 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is neardestruction.
10:15 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of thepoor is their poverty.
10:16 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of thewicked to sin.
10:17 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he thatrefuseth reproof erreth.
10:18 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth aslander, is a fool.
10:19 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he thatrefraineth his lips is wise.
10:20 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of thewicked is little worth.
10:21 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want ofwisdom.
10:22 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth nosorrow with it.
10:23 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man ofunderstanding hath wisdom.
10:24 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desireof the righteous shall be granted.
10:25 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but therighteous is an everlasting foundation.
10:26 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is thesluggard to them that send him.
10:27 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of thewicked shall be shortened.
10:28 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the expectationof the wicked shall perish.
10:29 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but destructionshall be to the workers of iniquity.
10:30 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall notinhabit the earth.
10:31 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the frowardtongue shall be cut out.
10:32 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the mouthof the wicked speaketh frowardness.

11:5 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but thewicked shall fall by his own wickedness.
11:6 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: buttransgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.
11:7 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and thehope of unjust men perisheth.
11:8 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked comethin his stead.
11:9 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but throughknowledge shall the just be delivered.
11:10 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: andwhen the wicked perish, there is shouting.
11:11 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it isoverthrown by the mouth of the wicked.
11:12 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man ofunderstanding holdeth his peace.
11:13 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithfulspirit concealeth the matter.
11:14 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude ofcounsellors there is safety.
11:15 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he thathateth suretiship is sure.
11:16 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain riches.
11:17 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that iscruel troubleth his own flesh.
11:18 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that sowethrighteousness shall be a sure reward.
11:19 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evilpursueth it to his own death.
11:20 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

18:22 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth favourof the LORD.
18:23 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.
18:24 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there isa friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

23:23 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,and understanding.
23:24 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he thatbegetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.
23:25 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare theeshall rejoice.
23:26 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways.

24:10 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.
24:11 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, andthose that are ready to be slain; 
24:12 If thou sayest, Behold, weknew it not; doth not he that pondereth the heart consider it? and hethat keepeth thy soul, doth not he know it? and shall not he render toevery man according to his works?  
24:13 My son, eat thou honey,because it is good; and the honeycomb, which is sweet to thy taste:
24:14 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thouhast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy expectation shallnot be cut off.
24:15 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of therighteous; spoil not his resting place: 
24:16 For a just man fallethseven times, and riseth up again: but the wicked shall fall intomischief.

24:18 Lest the LORD see it, and it displeasehim, and he turn away his wrath from him.
24:19 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious atthe wicked: 
24:20 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; thecandle of the wicked shall be put out.
24:21 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not withthem that are given to change: 
24:22 For their calamity shall risesuddenly; and who knoweth the ruin of them both?  
24:23 These thingsalso belong to the wise. It is not good to have respect of persons injudgment.
24:24 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall thepeople curse, nations shall abhor him: 
24:25 But to them that rebukehim shall be delight, and a good blessing shall come upon them.

24:30 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of theman void of understanding; 
24:31 And, lo, it was all grown over withthorns, and nettles had covered the face thereof, and the stone wallthereof was broken down.
24:32 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, andreceived instruction.
24:33 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of thehands to sleep: 
24:34 So shall thy poverty come as one thattravelleth; and thy want as an armed man.

25:8 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do inthe end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

30:3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.
30:4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath gatheredthe wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? whohath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and whatis his son's name, if thou canst tell?

30:6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou befound a liar.
30:7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before Idie: 
30:8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither povertynor riches; feed me with food convenient for me: 
30:9 Lest I be full,and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or lest I be poor, and steal,and take the name of my God in vain.
30:10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, andthou be found guilty.

30:21 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which itcannot bear: 
30:22 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when heis filled with meat; 
30:23 For an odious woman when she is married;and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
30:24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but theyare exceeding wise: 
30:25 The ants are a people not strong, yet theyprepare their meat in the summer; 
30:26 The conies are but a feeblefolk, yet make they their houses in the rocks; 
30:27 The locusts haveno king, yet go they forth all of them by bands; 
30:28 The spidertaketh hold with her hands, and is in kings' palaces.
30:29 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely ingoing: 
30:30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth notaway for any; 
30:31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, againstwhom there is no rising up.
30:32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thouhast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.
30:33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and thewringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrathbringeth forth strife.
31:1 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taughthim.
31:2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son ofmy vows?  
31:3 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to thatwhich destroyeth kings.
31:4 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine;nor for princes strong drink: 
31:5 Lest they drink, and forget thelaw, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
31:6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine untothose that be of heavy hearts.
31:7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery nomore.
31:8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as areappointed to destruction.
31:9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of thepoor and needy.
31:10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far aboverubies.
31:11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that heshall have no need of spoil.
31:12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
31:13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with herhands.
31:14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food fromafar.
31:15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to herhousehold, and a portion to her maidens.
31:16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of herhands she planteth a vineyard.
31:17 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her arms.
31:18 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goethnot out by night.
31:19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold thedistaff.
31:20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forthher hands to the needy.
31:21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all herhousehold are clothed with scarlet.
31:22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silkand purple.
31:23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among theelders of the land.
31:24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdlesunto the merchant.
31:25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice intime to come.
31:26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the lawof kindness.
31:27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth notthe bread of idleness.
31:28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,and he praiseth her.
31:29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest themall.
31:30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman thatfeareth the LORD, she shall be praised.
31:31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works praiseher in the gates.
